<h1 class="firstHeading">3.9 Simple NLFit</h1><p>This example shows how to do different kinds of Nonlinear fitting with the same data. And to access the fitting results in Origin.
</p><p>It is to demonstrate the following: 
</p>
<ol><li> Connect to Origin with OA_ConnectToOrigin.vi which maps to the ApplicationSI method in Origin. </li>
<li> Load an Origin Analysis Template (an OGW file) under Origin program folder.</li>
<li> Specify a path to load 1peak.txt, which is under &lt;Origin Program Folder&gt;\Samples\COM Server and Client\.</li>
<li> Send the data to a sheet named "Data" in the Analysis Template. </li>
<li> And then you can select a nonlinear fitting function in the dropdown list.</li>
<li> Trigger Recalculate in Origin. The Analysis Template will automatically update the "WaveformEnvelope" sheet.</li>
<li> Send the fitting curve and the fitting results from Origin to LabView.</li>
<li> Repeat the step 5 and step 7 to do different kinds of fitting until you press the Stop button.</li>
<li> Exit the Origin.</li></ol>
<p>This example is mainly composed of two parts. 
</p>
<ul><li> The figure below is to read data from an ASCII file and send the data to the Origin worksheet

<ul><li> The figure below is to perform the fitting process. And then send the fitting results to LabView.
