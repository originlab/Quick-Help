<h1 class="firstHeading">3.14 Sending XY Data To Origin</h1><p>This example is to complement the <a href="../../LabVIEW/LabVIEW/Sending_Waveforms_to_Origin.html" title="LabVIEW:Sending Waveforms to Origin">Sending Waveforms</a> example. Instead of waveforms, which is essentially just Y columns of data with sample rate, this example shows how to send XY data to Origin. More specifically, the VI demonstrates the following: 
</p>
<ol><li> Load an opj which contains a worksheet and a graph.</li>
<li> Generate two datasets (XY data) and send them to Origin.</li></ol>
<p>This example is mainly composed of two parts.
</p>
<ol><li>The following block shows how to load an opj file and find the specified worksheet. The found worksheet has also been cleared.

<li>The following block shows how to generate two datasets (XY data) and send them to Origin. Please note that a row index of -1 is used to indicate to append data to worksheet, which is a new connected added in SR6.
