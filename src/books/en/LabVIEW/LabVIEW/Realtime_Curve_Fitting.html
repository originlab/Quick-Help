<h1 class="firstHeading">3.8 Realtime Curve Fitting</h1><p>This example shows how to do realtime curve fitting in LabView with Origin.
</p><p>It is to demonstrate the following: 
</p>
<ol><li> Connect to a running Origin with OA_ConnectToOrigin.vi which maps to the ApplicationSI method in Origin. </li>
<li> Specify a path to load the analysis template "Simple NLFit.ogw", which is under &lt;Origin Program Folder&gt;\Samples\COM Server and Client\ folder.</li>
<li>Generate the Gaussian peaks with variable widths and import it to analysis tempate to do realtime fitting.</li>
<li>Show the dynamic changed widths on the waveform chart. </li></ol>
<p><br />
This example is mainly composed of two parts. 
</p>
<ul><li> The figure below is to load a template.</li></ul>
