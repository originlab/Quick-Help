<h1 class="firstHeading">3.7 On The Fly Analysis</h1><p>This example shows how to do on the fly analysis in LabView with Origin.
</p><p>It is to demonstrate the following: 
</p>
<ol><li> Connect to a running Origin with OA_ConnectToOrigin.vi which maps to the ApplicationSI method in Origin. </li>
<li> Specify a path to load On The Fly Analysis.opj, which is under &lt;Origin Program Folder&gt;\Samples\COM Server and Client\.</li>
<li> Send a simulated data to Origin and trigger Recalculate in Origin to do FFT analysis.</li></ol>
<p>This example is mainly composed of two parts. 
</p>
<ul><li> The figure below is to load an .opj.</li></ul>
