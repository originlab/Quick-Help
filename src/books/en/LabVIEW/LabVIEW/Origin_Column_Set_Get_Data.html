<h1 class="firstHeading">3.1 Origin Column Set Get Data</h1><p><br />
This example shows how to access Origin Worksheet Columns. The VI demonstrates the following: 
</p>
<ol><li> Connecting to a running Origin with OA_ConnectToOrigin.vi which maps to the ApplicationSI method in Origin.</li>
<li> Loading an Origin OPJ file under Origin's program folder.</li>
<li> Configuration of worksheet column objects, including setting them as even sampling (no separate X columns are needed).</li>
<li> Sending data to columns in a sheet named "Data" and getting data from another sheet named "Basic Stats".</li>
<li> Trigger recalculation in Origin before getting data so as to show how Origin can be used as an Analysis Template.</li></ol>
<p>Note that the VI using an .opj file named <b>Basic Stats on Data</b> is shipped with Origin, which contains an Analysis Template to do simple basic statistics computation. 
</p><p>Some important blocks are as below showing:
</p><p>This block is for generating some data to put into the two columns in our sample:
</p><p><a  class="image"><img alt="Labview Example1 1.png" src="../images/Origin_Column_Set_Get_Data/Labview_Example1_1.png?v=2887" width="248"  /></a>
</p><p>The blocks below are for setting up column labels and sending data to 2 columns in Origin:
</p><p><a  class="image"><img alt="Labview Example1 2.png" src="../images/Origin_Column_Set_Get_Data/Labview_Example1_2.png?v=2888" width="690"  /></a>
</p><p>The blocks below are for reading data from specified columns of result worksheet:
</p><p><a  class="image" title="D"><img alt="D" src="../images/Origin_Column_Set_Get_Data/Labview_Example1_4.png?v=2892" width="581"  /></a>
