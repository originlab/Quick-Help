<h1 class="firstHeading">3.2 Plotting XY Data with the Same X</h1><p><br />
This example shows how to make a XY data plot with the same X in LabVIEW with Origin.
</p>
<ol>
It is to demonstrate the following: 
<li>Calculate the expressions <i>X(x)</i> and <i>Y(x)</i> with the same variable <i>x</i>, <i>x</i> is increasing continuously when the program running, until the Stop button pressed down.
<li>Make a 2D line plot by using X and Y dynamically on a graph layer.
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The block diagram below is starting from an Origin project file named Simple XY.opj. The axis scale of the Graph in project was set by LabTalk script.

<li>Parametric function <i>X(x)</i> and <i>Y(x)</i> was generated, and the interval of parameter x is 0.1. The resulting values was sended to Worksheet and GraphLayer with a data update period of 100ms.
