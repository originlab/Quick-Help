<h1 class="firstHeading">3.10 Simulate DAQ</h1><p>This example shows you how to send the simulated data to Origin worksheet and plot it dynamically both in Origin and LabVIEW.
</p><p>This example is composed of three parts. 
</p>
<ul><li> The following part is to start Origin and add a workshseet with 2 columns. Then set the 2 columns' plot designation as Y and specify the data type of to double and plot them into a graph.

<ul><li> The following part is an event structure which contains two events.</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Timeout event: If this event is triggered, the LabView will generate the data and send it to an Origin worksheet and a LabView chart.</li></ul></dd></dl>

</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li>"Show Origin" Value Change event: If this event is triggered, Origin application will be shown. And the simulated data will be show in graph simultaneously. </li></ul></dd></dl>

</p>
<ul><li>The following part is to show final data in Origin and save the data.</li></ul>
