<h1 class="firstHeading">3.3 Send and Plot XYYY Data</h1><p><br />
</p><p>This example shows how to generate sine and square signal and make a 2D line plot in LabVIEW with Origin.
</p><p>It is to demonstrate the following: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate sine and square signal with the same sequence x, x is increasing continuously when program running, until the Stop button pressed down.
<li>Make a 2D line plot for signal waveform dynamically on a graph layer. In addition, you can specify the Long name and Unit for the line plot.
</ol>
<p><br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The block diagram below is starting from an Origin project file named Simple XY.opj and add a worksheet with 2 columns designated as Y, the Long Name and Units of columns are controllable.

<li>The block diagram below plot data in worksheet into Graph1 and set the scale for graph via LabTalk script.

<li>Y, Y1 and Y2 are sinusoidal and square wave generated, the wave data was output to the Worksheet and GraphLayer.
