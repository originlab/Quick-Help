To enter "debugging mode" in Code Builder:
</p>
<ol>
<li> Set one or more breakpoints in your function(s).  
<li>Make sure that the <b>Enable Breakpoints</b> button <a  class="image"><img alt="Button Enable Breakpoints 90.png" src="../images/Starting_The_Debugger/Button_Enable_Breakpoints_90.png?v=43068" width="16"  /></a> on the Debug toolbar (or the <b>Debug:Enable Breakpoints</b> menu command) is selected (this is the default state).  
<li>Call your function from Code Builder's <b>LabTalk Console</b> or from Origin.  For example, if your program starts by calling a function with the following function header:
<pre class="oc" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #0000ff;">void</span> myFunc<span style="color: #000000;">&#40;</span><span style="color: #000000;">&#41;</span></pre>
<p>Then you would start debugging from the LabTalk Console by typing the following function call and pressing ENTER.
</p><p><a  class="image"><img alt="Debugging From Labtalk Console 91.png" src="../images/Starting_The_Debugger/Debugging_From_Labtalk_Console_91.png?v=43261" width="319"  /></a>
</p>
</li></ol>
<p>After you called your function, execution will proceed to the first breakpoint.  You can also pause execution by pressing ESC or by selecting <b>Debug:Break</b>.  After performing either of these actions, the cursor becomes active on the line where program execution paused.
