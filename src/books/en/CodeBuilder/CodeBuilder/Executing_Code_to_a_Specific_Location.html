To debug your program up to a specific line in your source code, set a breakpoint at the line that you want to run up to (click in the line and press the F9 function key).  Then begin debugging by doing the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure that the <b>Enable Breakpoints</b> button <a  class="image"><img alt="Button Enable Breakpoints 90.png" src="../images/Executing_Code_To_A_Specific_Location/Button_Enable_Breakpoints_90.png?v=43068" width="16"  /></a> on the <b>Debug</b> toolbar (or the <b>Debug:Enable Breakpoints</b> menu command) is selected.  
<li>Call your function from Code Builder's <b>LabTalk Console</b> or from Origin.
<br />
The program will run up to the line containing the breakpoint.
</li>
<li>While still in Debug mode set another breakpoint (click in the line and press the F9 function key) several lines beneath the first breakpoint and then click the <b>Go</b> button <a  class="image"><img alt="Button Go 90.png" src="../images/Executing_Code_To_A_Specific_Location/Button_Go_90.png?v=43072" width="20"  /></a> on the <b>Debug</b> toolbar again.
<br />
The program will run up to the line containing the second breakpoint.
</li>
</ol>
<p>To continue debugging, you can step through your code line by line by clicking the <b>Step Into</b> button <a  class="image"><img alt="Button Step Into 90.png" src="../images/Executing_Code_To_A_Specific_Location/Button_Step_Into_90.png?v=43069" width="22"  /></a> on the Debug toolbar (or by selecting the <b>Debug:Step Into</b> menu command).  You can also step over or out of a function.  See the next section for more information on the <b>Step Into, Step Over, and Step Out</b> buttons.
