<h1 class="firstHeading">2.3.2.4 Origin Objects</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Origin-objs</p>
<p>There is a set of LabTalk Objects that is so integral to scripting in Origin that we give them a separate name: <span class="OIndex">Origin Object</span>s. These objects are visible in the graphical interface, and will be saved in an Origin project file (.OPJ). Origin Objects are the primary components of your <span class="OIndex">Origin Project</span>.  They are the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Page_(object).html" title="LabTalk:Page (object)">Page (Workbook/Graph Window/Matrix Book) Object</a>
<li><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Wks_(object).html" title="LabTalk:Wks (object)">Worksheet Object</a>
<li><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Wks.Col_(object)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" class="new" title="LabTalk:Wks.Col (object) (page does not exist)">Column Object</a>
<li><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Layer_(object).html" title="LabTalk:Layer (object)">Layer Object</a>
<li><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Mat_(object).html" title="LabTalk:Mat (object)">Matrix Object</a>
<li><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Datasets_(object).html" title="LabTalk:Datasets (object)">Dataset Object</a>
<li><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Graphic_Objects.html" title="LabTalk:Graphic Objects">Graphic Object</a>
</ol>
<p>Except loose datasets, Origin objects can be organized into three hierarchies:
</p>
<dl><dd><b><i>Workbook -&gt; Worksheet -&gt; Column</i></b></dd>
<dd><b><i>Matrix Book -&gt; Matrix Sheet -&gt; Matrix Object</i></b></dd>
<dd><b><i>Graph Window -&gt; Layer -&gt; Dataplot</i></b></dd></dl>
