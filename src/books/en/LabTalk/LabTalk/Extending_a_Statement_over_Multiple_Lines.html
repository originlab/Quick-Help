<h1 class="firstHeading">2.3.1.2.3 Extending a Statement over Multiple Lines</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Extending-a-stmt-over-Multiple-Lines</p>
<p>There are times when, for the sake of readability, you want to extend a single statement over more than one line.  One way to do this is with <span class="OIndex">braces</span> {}.  When an "open brace", <b>{</b>, is encountered in a script file, Origin searches for a "closed brace" , <b>}</b>, and executes the entire <span class="OIndex">block</span> of text as one statement.  For example, the following macro statement:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">def openDialog <span style="color: #000000;">&#123;</span>layer <span style="color: #000080;">-</span>s <span style="color: #0000dd;">1</span>;  axis x;<span style="color: #000000;">&#125;</span>;</pre>
<p>can also be written:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">def openDialog <span style="color: #000000;">&#123;</span>
                 layer <span style="color: #000080;">-</span>s <span style="color: #0000dd;">1</span>; 
                 axis x;
               <span style="color: #000000;">&#125;</span>;</pre>
<p>Both scripts are executed as a single statement, even though the second statement spans multiple lines.
</p><p><b>Note:</b>  There is a limit to the <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/String_registers.html#A_Note_on_Tokens" title="LabTalk:String registers"><span class="OIndex">length of script</span></a> that can be included between a set of braces {}.  The scripts between the {} are translated internally and the translated scripts must be less than 1140 bytes (after substitution).  In place of long blocks of LabTalk code, programmers can use LabTalk <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Macro_Statements.html" title="LabTalk:Macro Statements">macros</a> or the <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Run_(object).html" title="LabTalk:Run (object)">run.section()</a> and <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Run_(object).html" title="LabTalk:Run (object)">run.file()</a> object methods.
