<h1 class="firstHeading">2.3.1.2.5 Order of Evaluation in Statements</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Order-of-Evaluation-in-stmts</p>
<p>When a script is executed, it is sent to the LabTalk <span class="OIndex">interpreter</span><span class="OIndex HasShownIndex" style="display:none">LabTalk Interpreter</span> and evaluated as follows:
</p>
<h4><a name="The_script_is_broken_down_into_its_component_statements"></a><span class="mw-headline">The script is broken down into its component statements</span></h4>
<p>Statements are identified by type using the following recognition order:  <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Assignment_Statements.html" title="LabTalk:Assignment Statements">assignment</a>, <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Macros.html" title="LabTalk:Macros">macro</a>, <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Command_Statements.html" title="LabTalk:Command Statements">command</a>, <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Arithmetic_Statement.html" title="LabTalk:Arithmetic Statement">arithmetic</a>, and <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Function_Statements.html" title="LabTalk:Function Statements">function</a>.  The interpreter first looks for an exposed (not hidden in parentheses or quotation marks) assignment operator.  If none is found, it looks to see if the first word is a macro name.  It then checks if the first word is a command name.  The interpreter then looks for an arithmetic operation, and finally, the interpreter checks whether the statement is a function.
</p><p>The <span class="OIndex">recognition order</span> can have significant effect on script functions.  For example, the following assignment statement:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">type <span style="color: #000080;">=</span> <span style="color: #0000dd;">1</span>;</pre>
<p>assigns the value 1 to the variable type.  This occurs even though type is (also) a LabTalk command, since assignments come before commands in recognition order.  However, since commands precede arithmetic expressions in recognition order, in the following statement:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">type <span style="color: #000080;">+</span> <span style="color: #0000dd;">1</span>;</pre>
<p>the command is carried out first, and the string, + 1, prints out.

<ul><li>Assignment statements:  String variables to the left of the assignment operator are not expressed unless enclosed by parentheses.  Otherwise, all string variables are expressed, and all special notation ( <b><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/String_Substitution.html" title="LabTalk:String Substitution">%()</a></b> and <b><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Numeric_to_String_Conversion.html" title="LabTalk:Numeric to String Conversion">$()</a></b>) is substitution processed.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Macro statements:  <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Macros.html#Passing_Arguments_to_Macros" title="LabTalk:Macros">Macro arguments</a> are substitution processed and passed.</li></ul>
<ul><li>Command statements:  If a command is a raw string, it is not sent to the substitution processor.  Otherwise, all special notation is substitution processed.  </li></ul>
<ul><li>Arithmetic statements:  All expressions are substitution processed and expressed.</li></ul>
