<h1 class="firstHeading">3.6.5.4 EndOpen</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>EndOpen-macro</p>
<p>The <b>EndOpen</b> macro is triggered when Origin is directed to start by opening a specific project (files of type *.OPJ or *.ORG).  To automatically open a specific project when starting Origin you specify the project name
</p>
<ul><li>in the Windows <b>Start: Run</b> dialog box. </li>
<li>in the Target text box of an Origin shortcut's <b>Properties</b> window.  </li></ul>
<p><br />
For example, typing 
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd>C:\...\Origin70.exe MyProject.opj</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>in the Windows <b>Start: Run</b> dialog box and clicking OK, starts Origin and automatically opens the project MYPROJECT.OPJ.  
</p><p><br />
When Origin is directed to start by opening a specific project, the <b>EndOpen</b> macro is executed immediately after Origin is started and the specified project is fully opened. The <b>EndOpen</b> macro is unique in that a define statement for the <b>EndOpen</b> macro must be contained in a configuration file (files of type *.CNF) and be executed during the Origin start up procedure to ensure that the macro is <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Define_(command).html" title="LabTalk:Define (command)">define</a> in time for its triggering event. The file MACROS.CNF (found in the Origin software folder) contains a commented out define statement for the <b>EndOpen</b> macro which can be uncommented and modified to insure timely definition.
