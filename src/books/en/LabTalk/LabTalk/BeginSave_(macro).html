<h1 class="firstHeading">3.6.4.3 BeginSave</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>BeginSave-macro</p>
<p>The BeginSave macro is triggered when the current document (project) or a child window is saved.  The BeginSave macro is not triggered when a template is saved.  Saving a project or a child window by selecting File:Save Project, File:Save Project As, or File:Save Window As from the Origin main menu or by issuing the save command triggers the execution of the BeginSave macro.  Exiting Origin by selecting File:Exit from the Origin main menu, by clicking the Origin close window system icon, or by issuing the <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Exit_(command).html" title="LabTalk:Exit (command)">exit</a> command (and then electing to save the modified project before exiting) also triggers the execution of the BeginSave macro.
