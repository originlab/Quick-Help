<p>The copypage object is a sub-object of the system object.  The copypage object properties allow you to read and alter copy page and graphic export-related settings which are set in the OPTION.CNF file.  These settings can also be accessed in the Options dialog box.

<p>ClipBorderW and Closeness are related properties.  Both properties affect the amount of the page in the graph window that is copied or exported.  By default, all the objects within a "bounding box" plus a "border" are copied/exported.  ClipBorderW allows you to set a value for the "border" around the "bounding box".  This value is the percent of the width of the "bounding box".  The default value is 6.  Enable or disable the "border" with the Closeness property.  (See the Examples section.)

<p>Closeness and ClipBorderW are related properties.  Both properties affect the amount of the page in the graph window that is copied or exported.  When closeness = 1 (default), copy/export the page within the "bounding box" plus add the "border" set by clipBorderW.  When closeness = 2, copy/export only the page within the "bounding box".  When closeness = 4, copy/export the entire graph page.  (See the Examples section.)

<p>This script sets the border around the graph page "bounding box" to 10% of the bounding box width.  It then sets the Copy Page and File:Export Page menu commands to copy/export the bounding box plus the border when selected.
