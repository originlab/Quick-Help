<h1 class="firstHeading">2.5.2.1 Interactive Execution</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Interactive-Execution</p>
<p><span class="OIndex" style="display:none">script, interactive execution</span>You can execute LabTalk commands or X-functions line-by-line (or a selection of multiple lines) to execute step-by-step. The advantage of this procedure is that you can verify the result of the issued command, and according to the result or error, you can act appropriately.
</p><p>To execute LabTalk commands interactively, you can enter them in the following places: 
</p>
<ul><li> <a href="../../LabTalk/Script/From_Script_and_Command_Window.html" title="Script:From Script and Command Window">Classic Script Window</a></li>
<li> <a href="../../LabTalk/Script/From_Script_and_Command_Window.html" title="Script:From Script and Command Window">Command Window</a> in Origin's main window</li>
<li> Command &amp; Results Windows in Code Builder</li></ul>
<p>The characteristics and the advantages of each window are as follows:
</p>
<h3><a name="Classic_Script_Window"></a><span class="mw-headline">Classic Script Window</span></h3>
<p>This window can be open from the <b>Window</b> main menu. This is the most flexible place for advanced users to execute LabTalk scripts. Enter key will execute 
</p>
<ol><li> the current line if cursor has no selection</li>
<li> the selected block if there is a selection</li></ol>
<p>You can use Ctrl+Enter to add a line without executing. There is also a <b>Script Execution</b> option on the Edit menu to toggle between editing and interactive execution.
</p>
<h3><a name="Command_Window_in_Origin.27s_Main_Window"></a><span class="mw-headline">Command Window in Origin's Main Window</span></h3>
<p>You can enter a LabTalk command at the command prompt in the Command Window. The result would be printed immediately after the entered command line. Command Window has various convenient features such as 
command history panel, auto-completion, roll back support for utilizing previously executed commands, saving previously executed commands to an OGS file, etc. Note, however, that you cannot edit multi-line scripts within the Command Window.
</p><p>To learn how to use the Command window, see <b><a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/Category/The_Origin_Command_Window.html">The Origin Command Window</a></b> chapter in the Origin help file.

<h3><a name="Command_.26_Results_Windows_in_Code_Builder"></a><span class="mw-headline">Command &amp; Results Windows in Code Builder</span></h3>
<p>Code Builder is Origin's integrated development environment useful in debugging LabTalk scripts as well as Origin C code, X-Function code, etc. In Code Builder, use various convenient debugging tools like setting up  break points, step-by-step execution, inspection of the values of variables, etc.
