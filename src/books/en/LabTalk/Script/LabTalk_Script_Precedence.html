<h1 class="firstHeading">2.3.3 LabTalk Script Precedence</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>LT-Script-Precedence</p>
<p>Now that we know that there are several objects, like Macros, Origin C functions, X-Functions, OGS files, etc. So, we should be careful to avoid naming conflicts between these objects, which could cause confusion and lead to incorrect results. If duplicate names are unavoidable, LabTalk will run objects according to set of precedence rules. The following list of LabTalk objects are arranged top to bottom in descending precedence. 
</p>
<ol>
<li> Macros
<li> OGS Files
<li> X-Functions
<li> LT object methods, like run.file(<i>FileName</i>)
<li> LT callable Origin C functions
<li> LT commands (can be abbreviated)
</ol>
