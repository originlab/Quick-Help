Many analysis tools in Origin provide a Recalculate option, allowing for results to update when source data is modified, such as when importing new data to replace existing data. A workbook containing such operations can be saved as an <b>Analysis Template</b> for repeated use with <b>Batch Processing</b>. 
</p><p>The <b>Set Column Values</b> feature can also be used to create such Analysis Templates when custom script is needed for your analysis. 
</p><p>In order to create Analysis Templates using the Set Column Values feature, the following steps are recommended:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up your data sheet, such as importing a representative data file.
<li> Add an extra column to the data sheet, or to a new sheet in the same workbook.
<li>Open the <b>Set Column Values</b> dialog from this newly added column.
<li>Enter the desired analysis script in the <b>Before Formula Scripts</b> panel. Note that your script can call X-Functions to perform multiple operations on the data.
<li>In you script, make sure to reference at least one column or cell of your data sheet that will get replaced with new data. You can do this by defining a range variable that points to a data column and then use that range variable in your script for computing your custom analysis output.
<li>Set the <b>Recalculate</b> drop-down in the dialog to either <i>Manual</i> or <i>Auto</i>, and press OK.
<li>Use the <b>File: Save Workbook as Analysis Template...</b> menu item to save the Analysis Template. 
</ol>
<p>For an example on setting up such a template using script, please refer to the Origin tutorial: <a class="external text" href="../../Tutorial/Tutorial/Creating_Analysis_Templates_using_Set_Column_Value.html">Creating Analysis Templates using Set Column Value</a>.
