<h1 class="firstHeading">2.6.1 String Variables and String Registers</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>String-vars-and-String-Registers</p>
<p>In Origin, string processing is supported in two ways: with string variables, and with string registers.  In general, we encourage the use of string variables as they are more intuitive (i.e., more like strings in other programming languages) and are supported by many pre-defined string methods; both of which are advantages over string registers.

<p>A <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Data_Types_and_Variables.html#String_Variables" title="LabTalk:Data Types and Variables">string variable</a> is created by declaration and/or assignment, and its name is always followed by a $-sign.  For example:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #008000;">// Creates by declaration a variable named 'aa' of the string type; </span>
<span style="color: #008000;">//'aa' is empty (i.e., &quot;&quot;)</span>
string aa<span style="color: #000080;">$</span>;    

<span style="color: #008000;">// Assigns to 'aa' a character sequence</span>
aa<span style="color: #000080;">$</span> <span style="color: #000080;">=</span> <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&quot;Happy&quot;</span>;       

<span style="color: #008000;">// Creates and assigns a value to string variable 'bb', </span>
<span style="color: #008000;">//all on the same line</span>
string bb<span style="color: #000080;">$</span> <span style="color: #000080;">=</span> <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&quot;Yes&quot;</span>;  

<span style="color: #008000;">// Creates and assigns a value to string variable 'cc' with no declaration </span>
<span style="color: #008000;">//(see note below)</span>
cc<span style="color: #000080;">$</span> <span style="color: #000080;">=</span> <span style="color: #ff00ff;">&quot;Project&quot;</span>;</pre>
<p>Note: Because string variable <b>cc</b> was not declared, it is given Project scope, which means all routines, functions, or otherwise can see it as long as the project is open.  Declared variables <b>aa</b> and <b>bb</b> are given Local (or Session) scope.  For more on scope, see <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Data_Types_and_Variables.html" title="LabTalk:Data Types and Variables">Variables and Scope</a>.

<p>Prior to Version 8.0, Origin supported string processing with string registers.  As such, they continue to be supported by more recent versions, and you may see them used in script programming examples.  There are 26 string registers, corresponding to the 26 letters of the English alphabet, each preceeded by a&#160;%-sign, i.e.,&#160;%A--%Z.  They can be assigned a character sequence just like string variables, the differences are in the way they are handled and interpreted, as the examples below illustrate.  As a warning, several of the 26 string registers are reserved for system use, most notably, the ranges&#160;%C--%I, and&#160;%X--%Z.  For complete documentation on their use, see <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/String_registers.html" title="LabTalk:String registers">String Registers</a>.
