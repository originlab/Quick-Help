<p>When you apply a mask to data points in a graph, the masked data are hidden or shown in the graph (user's choice) and are highlighted in a contrasting color in the worksheet.

<p>While the masked points can be hidden in the graph, they are <i>never</i> hidden in the worksheet and if you were to select the worksheet then copy and paste your selection to a new sheet, you would find that the masked data were also copied.
</p><p>If you want an easy way to output <i>only the unmasked data</i>:
</p>
<ol><li> Start by using the <b>Data Highlighter</b> tool <a  class="image"><img alt="Button Data Highlighter.png" src="../images/Extract_unmasked_data_to_new_sheet/Button_Data_Highlighter.png?v=57678" width="25"  /></a> to select <i>all data in the graph</i> (masked or unmasked, it doesn't matter). Only the data that are unmasked will be selected. </li>
<li> You can then select the entire worksheet, copy, then paste to a new sheet. Only the unmasked data will be copied to your new sheet.</li></ol>
