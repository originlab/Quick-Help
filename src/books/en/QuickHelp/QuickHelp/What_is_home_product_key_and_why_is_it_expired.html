<h1 class="firstHeading">6.90 FAQ-1117 What is a "Home-use" Product Key and why is it expired?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Home-PK-Expired</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 3/9/2023</p>
<p><span class='headerInParagraph'>"I see two product keys in my OriginLab account, one marked as "Primary" and other as "Home-use". However, the "Home-use" key says "expired" on the status. Why?"</span>
</p><p>If you purchased one perpetual license with a <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Purchase/Maintenance" target="_blank">Maintenance plan</a> benefits package, you will see two types of Product Keys listed under your account. The "Primary" one is the permanent license you have purchased. And you are given the Home-use key as one of the Maintenance benefits. This key is running in conjunction with your Maintenance plan and thus will expire along with it.
