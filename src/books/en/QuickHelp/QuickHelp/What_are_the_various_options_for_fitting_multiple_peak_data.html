<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>Origin offers multiple tools to perform peak analysis. The following is a general guideline on which tool may be suitable for which type of data. For more details on each tool, please refer to the help file.<br /><br />
</p><p><b>Quick Peaks Gadget</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Accessible from Gadgets menu when a graph is active
<li> Ideal for graphical analysis of peak data containing a small number of peaks
<li> Select region of interest on graph to analyze a sub range of plotted data
<li> Multiple methods for detecting and subtracting baseline
<li> Option available to fit peaks using available peak functions (OriginPro Only)
<li> Save settings to Theme for repeat analysis of similar data
<li> Does not provide batch processing capability
</ul>
<p><br /><br />
<b>Multiple Peak Fit Tool</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Accessible from the <b>Analysis: Peaks and Baseline: Multiple Peak Fit</b> menu when either worksheet or graph is active
<li> Ideal for fitting peaks to data with a small number of peaks, where peaks are well separated
<li> Click and select peak centers, then perform peak fitting with option to switch to NLFit dialog for full control
<li> Does not provide baseline correction capability
</ul>
<p><br /><br />
<b>Peak Analyzer</b>
</p>
<ul>
<li> Accessible from the <b>Analysis: Peaks and Baseline: Peak Analyzer</b> menu when either worksheet or graph is active
<li> Ideal for peak analysis on datasets with large number of peaks
<li> Wizard interface with preview window to view step by step results
<li> Multiple analysis goals: Find Peaks, Integrate Peaks,  Fit Peaks (OriginPro Only)
<li> Multiple methods for detecting and subtracting baseline
<li> Save settings to Theme for repeat analysis of similar data
<li> Output includes more than 15 peak properties when fitting peaks
<li> Ability to assign different peak functions to different peaks
<li> Ability to flexibly share peak parameters and apply bounds and constraints when fitting
<li> Themes saved from Peak Analyzer can be used for batch analysis using the “Analysis: Peaks and Baseline: Batch Peak Analysis using Theme” menu item
</ul>
