<p>From Origin2018, different versions share the same licenses, which means that the newer version will inherit all license from the old version, along with their product keys and usage status.

</p><p>No, you do not need to deactivate your old version license. When you start Origin of new version, Origin will activate itself automatically.
</p><p><font color="blue"><b>If you choose to install the new version on a new computer,</b></font>

<p>No, you do not need to deactivate your old version license. The installation and license process for your new version is completely separate and independent of your old version.
