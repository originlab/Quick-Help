<p>If you intend to export graphs or layout pages for further editing in Adobe Illustrator, we strongly recommend that you export your graph or layout as a <b>Scalable Vector Graphics</b> (<b>SVG</b>) file (For graphs, choose <b>File: Export Graph</b> or <b>File: Export Graphs (Advanced)</b>; for layout windows, <b>File: Export Layout as Image</b> or <b>File: Export Layout (Advanced)</b>).

This is generally preferred by users who edit their SVG export in Adobe Illustrator. However, you can modify this behavior by doing the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Before export, open the Script Window (<b>Window: Script Window</b>), enter the following, then press Enter:
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">SVGTC <span style="color: #000080;">=</span> <span style="color: #0000dd;">0</span></pre></li>
<li>Export your graph or layout as SVG, as described above.
</ol>
<p><br />
For information on the system variable <b>@SVGTC</b>, see <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#S">this page</a>.

</p><p>Sometimes user would right click on a graph and choose <b>Copy page</b>, and then paste it into Adobe Illustrator for further editing (It does not support OLE). It is an easy way if you want to edit sub-elements like axis title inside AI. It is because <b>Copy Page</b> internally creates an EMF format file (in clipboard) and then paste it into AI. On the contrast, if you <b>Copy Graph as Image</b>, the whole graph is a single element. 
</p><p>However, AI draws EMF in a different way from Origin and thus <b>Copy Page</b> way has many limits. Therefore, we strongly recommend that you export graph as SVG format instead for editing purpose.

<p>From Origin 2017, the AI Image type is hidden from <a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/ExpGraph.html">the <b>Export Graph</b> dialog</a>. If you want to edit graphs in Adobe Illustrator, please export graph as EMF type instead.

<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">@HAI<span style="color: #000080;">=</span><span style="color: #0000dd;">0</span>;</pre> 
<p>in the <b>Command Window</b>. Then open <b>File: Export Graph</b> dialog. You can see AI in the <b>Image Type</b> drop-down list. Refer to <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#H.2CI.2CJ.2CK">system variable list</a> for details of @HAI.
