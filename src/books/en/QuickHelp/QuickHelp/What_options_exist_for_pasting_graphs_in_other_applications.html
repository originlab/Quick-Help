<p>1.  In Origin, select <b>Edit: Copy Page</b>.
</p><p>2.  In the other application, such as Microsoft Office applications, select <b>Edit: Paste Special</b>. The <b>Paste Special</b> dialog will open.  
</p><p>3.  You have the choice of an <b>Origin Graph Object</b> or a <b>Picture</b>.
</p><p>4.  After you make your selection, click <b>OK</b>.
</p><p>The <b>Origin Graph Object</b> is an OLE object that contains an image of the graph plus the data needed by Origin to reproduce and edit the graph in Origin.  The <b>Picture</b> is just an image of the graph. The application may offer editing of the Picture object, but it's possible that such edits may destroy some formatting exclusive to Origin.

<td><b>Note</b>:  Inserting an Origin Graph Object will produce a larger file than would inserting a Picture.

<p>When you double-click on the pasted Origin Graph Object (and Origin is installed on your computer), then Origin opens with the graph ready for editing.  Choose File:Exit when you are done editing.

<p>As an alternative, Origin objects inserted into a destination file can be edited without leaving the destination application. This editing method works by in-place activation of a subset of Origin's graph editing tools.  
</p><p>To enable in-place activation:
</p>
<ol><li>From the Origin menu, select <b>Preference: Options</b>, and choose the <b>Graph</b> tab.</li>
<li>Select the <b>Enable OLE In-place Activation</b> check box.</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b> to close the dialog box. (If you are prompted to Save as Origin's startup options, click Yes.)  </li>
<li>Close Origin.</li></ol>
<p>To edit the graph using in-place activation:
</p><p>Double-click on the embedded (not linked) Origin graph in the destination application.  The Origin graph is now editable by double-clicking or right-clicking on the selected object and choosing from various Origin shortcut menu commands.  
</p>

<tr>
<td><b>Note</b>:  In general, in-place activation is not the recommended method for editing embedded Origin graphs; you do not have access to many useful Origin features - for instance, the workbook windows that contain the data plotted in the graph.  In such a case you can right-click and choose to Open Origin.
