<p>When you want to insert an Origin graph in a <b>Word</b> file, you may find that even if you customize the same font size in Origin, it still did not match that font size in <b>Word</b>. 
</p><p>To use the standard font size in Origin graph, you should first activate the graph, click <b>Graph:  Convert to Standard Font Size</b>. The font size in graph would be as the same as those in <b>Word</b>. Then export the graph again and insert it back to the <b>Word</b> file.
</p><p>Please note that this option is only available for those graphs created before 8.5.1 SR0 version and reopened in Later Origin version. For graphs created in 8.5.1 SR0 or other later versions, the font size will be automatically converted to standard font size.
