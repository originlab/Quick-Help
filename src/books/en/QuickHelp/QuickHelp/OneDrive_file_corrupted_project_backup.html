<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/8/2022</p>
<p>When opening Origin files from a folder synced to a Microsoft OneDrive account, some users report seeing an error message that says that the file is damaged, but that a previous version of the file might still be available. The user is instructed to choose <b>Help: Open Folder: Project Backup</b> to obtain the backup file.

<p>Users have reported the following:
</p>
<ul><li> After clicking <b>OK</b> to the error message, the file opens normally and appears intact.</li>
<li> If the user attempts to save the file, however, Origin defaults to saving in \Backup. This necessitates browsing to the OneDrive folder and saving the file at that location. </li></ul>
<p>This error message is not seen when the user account has full administrative privileges. We are still investigating the details, but users report that switching from their regular user account to an administrator account with elevated permissions, seems to resolve the issue.
