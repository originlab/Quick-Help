<p>The Origin <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/What_is_the_command_window.html" title="QuickHelp:What is the command window">Command Window</a> stores previously-issued commands. This command history is written to a text file (LTHistory.txt) in your <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_User_Files_Folder.html">User Files Folder</a>. 
</p><p>While this command history can be useful for looking up or re-running previously issued script, be aware that it accumulates over time. This can lead to long delays in opening the Command Window. When this happens, the fix is to delete or drastically reduce the size of LTHistory.txt. You can also clear the command history by right-clicking in the History panel (left-panel) of the Command Window and choosing <b>Clear</b>.
</p><p>If you routinely run large blocks of script from the command line, it is probably best to do so from the Script Window (which does not store a command history).
