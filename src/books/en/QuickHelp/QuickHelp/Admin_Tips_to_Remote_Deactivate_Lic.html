<p>As a benefit of maintenance service, you can use “remote deactivate” to release the product key/license immediately. The old Origin will be deactivated and new member can use the product key to obtain a license immediately. Note: This requires Origin to have internet access for checking validity of the license.
</p><p>Refer to the second tip in <a href="../../License/Category/Multi-User_Node-Locked_License(License).html#If_your_licensed_Origin_computer_is_no_longer_available" title="Category:Multi-User Node-Locked License(License)">this page</a> -&gt; "If you are the administrator of the package" section for detailed steps of remote deactivating a product key.
