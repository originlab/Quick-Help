<h1 class="firstHeading">2.29 FAQ-462 What is the difference between data matrix and image matrix?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Data-and-Image</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 4/10/2020</p>
<p>A matrix window can have multiple sheets and each sheet can have multiple matrix objects. Each matrix object in turn can contain an <b>image</b>, or <b>data</b>. 
</p><p>When an image file is imported into a matrix object, Origin by default sets the matrix object to be of type <b>image</b>. This is indicated by the "image" icon <a  class="image"><img alt="Matrix object image button.png" src="../images/What_is_the_difference_between_data_and_image/Matrix_object_image_button.png?v=46298" width="17"  /></a> displayed at the top right corner of the matrix window. 
</p><p>When a matrix object is filled with numerical values, by importing data, using a <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Entering_Expressions_in_the_Set_Values_Dialog.html">Set Values</a> formula, or when the user converts an image to data, the matrix object type will be <b>data</b>, and this will be indicated in the top right corner of the matrix window with the "data" icon <a  class="image"><img alt="Matrix object data button.png" src="../images/What_is_the_difference_between_data_and_image/Matrix_object_data_button.png?v=46299" width="17"  /></a>.
</p><p>Whether the matrix contains an <b>image</b> or <b>data</b>, you can toggle the window view between <b>Image Mode</b> and <b>Data Mode</b> using the <b>View</b> menu. 
</p>

<p>The <b>Data Mode</b> view will display in each cell, a number or a set of numbers that correspond to each pixel of the image. Thus, for example, if an RGB image was imported, each cell will contain three numbers such as <b>70 123 25</b>. If a grayscale image was imported, each cell will contain a single number such as <b>25186</b> or <b>210</b>.
</p><p>The <b>Image Mode</b> view will simply display the image similar to viewing the image in an external application.
</p><p>With <b>image</b> matrices, one can perform simple image processing and transformation operations, which are available from the <b>Image</b> menu. Most numerical operations such as 2D FFT are however not available until the image is converted to <b>data</b>. The <b>Image:Conversion:Convert to Data...</b> menu item can be used to convert <b>image</b> to <b>data</b>.
</p>
<h2><a name="If_matrix_contains_data"></a><span class="mw-headline">If matrix contains <b>data</b></span></h2>
<p>The <b>Data Mode</b> view will display the numeric values in each cell.
</p><p>The <b>Image Mode</b> view will display a 256-level grayscale image representation of the data in the matrix. The minimum data value is assigned the color black and the maximum data value is assigned the color white, and all other values are assigned gray colors in between, using a linear mapping of values. Note that the data values can be any range of numbers such as fractional numbers from the results of a computation, and are not limited to positive integers. 
</p><p>The minimum and maximum values used for the grayscale map can be changed using <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variables.html#X1.2C_X2.2C_X3.2C_Y1.2C_Y2.2C_Y3.2C_Z1.2C_Z2.2C_Z3">the system variables <b>z1</b> and <b>z2</b></a>. Thus one could open the <b>Script Window</b> and type commands such as below to change the grayscale map.
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">z1<span style="color: #000080;">=</span><span style="color: #0000dd;">10</span>;
z2<span style="color: #000080;">=</span><span style="color: #0000dd;">35</span>;</pre>
<p>Changing z1 and z2 values allows the user to view the <b>data</b> matrix with the desired contrast. Thus, for example if a 16-bit grayscale TIFF image with very small intensity values in each pixel is imported into a matrix, it may appear as black/blank, as by default the matrix is in <b>image</b> type. But if the user converts the image to <b>data type</b>, then user can set z1 and z2 to desired values to view the available data in more detail.

<h2><a name="Changing_Display_Palette"></a><span class="mw-headline">Changing Display Palette</span></h2>
<p>If a matrix contains Data or an 8bit gray scale image and is in <b>Image Mode</b> view, you can apply a different display palette. Select <b>Matrix: Apply Palette to Color Map</b> and use the browse button in the dialog to select a different Palette file.
