<h1 class="firstHeading">5.66 FAQ-932 Why does Origin declare the saving file is read-only?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Declare-saving-file-read-only</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/3/2019</p>
<p>Sometimes, when you are saving an Origin project file(*.opju) in Origin 2018b or later, Origin might declares that the saving file is read-only. When this happens, you might check whether you have the User Files Folder(UFF), Autosave, Unsaved, TempSave, and Backup folder on a network drive. Even if you have changed the location of User Files Folder to be a local path, the file's read-only warning might still pops up when saving it.
</p><p>In this case, please try to move all folders(UFF, Autosave, Unsaved, TempSave, and Backup folder) from network to the local drive.

<ol><li> Select <b>Preference: Options</b> menu to open the <b>Options</b> dialog.</li>
<li> Switch to the <b>System Path</b> tab, select <b>User Files Folder</b>, <b>Autosave</b>, <b>Project Backup</b> and U<b>nsaved Files</b> separately  and use the <b>Change...</b> button to change the paths to local drive locations.</li></ol>

<p>Here, we don't provide a GUI way to change the path of TemSave folder, so you need open the <b>Registry Editor</b> to:<br /> 
change value of TemSave key if existing, <br />
or<br /> 
add a new key TemSave and give it a value for path.
</p><p>You can follow <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/Windows_Freeze_Crash_when_Origin_Starts_or_is_Running.html#Changing_folder_locations_for_Origin" title="QuickHelp:Windows Freeze Crash when Origin Starts or is Running">the steps in this FAQ</a> to change the registry key value or add a string to give a local drive path for Origin's TemSave folder.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> For Origin 2018 or earlier, you only need move the AutoSave folder and User Files folder from network to local drive path to avoid the file's ready-only warning.
