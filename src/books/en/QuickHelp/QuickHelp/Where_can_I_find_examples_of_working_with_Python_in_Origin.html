<p>Origin provides a few built in examples of working with Python, and they are organized under the path <i>&lt;Origin EXE Folder&gt;\Samples\Python</i>.
</p><p>There are two .py files which can be run directly from Origin (see the LabTalk reference of <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Run_(command).html#-pyf.3B_Execute_Python_File"><b>run -pyf</b></a> for details).
</p><p>The other Origin project files show various examples of using Python to access Origin objects (data, graph.etc). You can open the project file and click the <b>Show Python Code</b> button to access the .py file, and the .py file actually can be also found in the <b>Project</b> folder of <b>Workspace</b> in <b>Code Builder</b>.
