</p><p>You can set a levelâ€™s color fill to <b>None</b> in your contour plot to make it display as transparent. By doing this, you can see through the region that corresponds to that level. However, sometimes you do not see the effect on your graph. In this case, please check whether the <b>Graphic Image Caching</b> setting of the graph layer has been set to <b>None</b>. If not, the transparent effect cannot work properly.
</p><p><br />
To access the graph layer's <b>Graphic Image Caching</b> setting:
</p>
<ul><li> Right-click on the layer icon and select <b>Layer Properties</b> from the short-cut menu. This opens the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog for this layer. Click on the <b>Display/Speed</b> tab. If necessary, set <b>Graphic Image Caching</b> to <b>None</b> and click <b>Apply</b>. </li>
<li> Alternately, right-click on an empty portion of the graph layer and check the <b>Display Caching</b> setting, changing the selection to <b>None</b>, as needed.</li></ul>
