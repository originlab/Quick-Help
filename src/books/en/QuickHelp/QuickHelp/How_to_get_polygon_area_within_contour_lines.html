<p><br />
To quickly read the polygon area within a single contour line, select the contour and read the area from <b>Data Display</b> window. 
</p><p>To select a single contour line, you must click on it three times:
</p>
<ol><li> The first click selects all contours in the layer. </li>
<li> The second click selects all contour lines of the same Z level. </li>
<li> The third click selects a single contour line. </li></ol>

</p><p>When a single contour line is selected, you can read the polygon area enclosed by the contour line. Note that the value Z for the level is also shown in the <b>Data Display</b> window along with the polygon area. You can right-click the <b>Data Display</b> window and select <b>Copy Text</b> to copy and paste the values to other places.
</p><p>Starting with Origin 2016 SR1, you can right-click on your selection (all, of a given Z value, single contour) and choose <b>Extract Contour Lines</b>. Data, including polygon area, are output to a new workbook.
