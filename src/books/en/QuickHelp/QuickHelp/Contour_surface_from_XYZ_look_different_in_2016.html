<h1 class="firstHeading">1.163 FAQ-822 Why do my contour and surface plots from XYZ data look different in version 2016 and higher?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Contour_surface_from_XYZ_look_different_in_2016</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/8/2019</p>
<p>A contour triangulation algorithm that plots raw X and Y data was implemented for Origin 2016. Previous versions performed some normalization of X and Y data before plotting. The change will be most noticeable if there are large scale range differences between your X and Y values. Such contour and surface plots of XYZ worksheet data may look very different in 2016 (or higher versions) as compared to previous versions.
</p><p>To normalize data before plotting, click on your graph to activate the graph window, then choose <b>Format: Page</b>. In Plot Details, click the <b>Miscellaneous</b> tab and enable <b>Normalize Data for XYZ Contour/Surface Plot</b>.
