<h1 class="firstHeading">1.161 FAQ-818 Why are dashed lines not working in my line + symbol plot?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Dashed_lines_drawn_incorrectly_line_symbol_plot</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 9/10/2023</p>
<p>Some customers have reported that when they set <b>Line Style</b> to <b>Dash</b> in their Line + Symbol plot, the line does not draw as dashed, but appears solid. Customers sometimes add that they have set Symbol Size to 0, but this failed to resolve the problem.
</p><p>Generally, this issue is related to a combination of these factors:
</p>
<ul><li> A high density of plotted points.</li>
<li> A thick dashed line width (<i>1.5</i> or more).</li></ul>
<p><br />
<span class='headerInParagraph'>You can handle this in one of several ways:</span>
</p>
<ul><li> If you need a Line + Symbol plot, select menu <b>Preferences: Options</b>. In the <b>Options</b> dialog, activate Grqaph tab. In the Origin Dash Lines group, select your dash type from the <b>Dash Definition</b> drop-down and enter larger numbers in the combo box, e.g. "40 44".</li></ul>

<ul><li> Try setting your line width to a lower value.</li>
<li> If you are setting Symbol Size to <i>0</i>, ask yourself why you need a Line + Symbol plot. If a line plot will do the job, simply set <b>Plot Type</b> to <b>Line</b> (bottom of <b>Plot Details</b> dialog box). This typically fixes the problem of a dashed line drawing as a solid line, no matter the line width.</li>
<li> In the past, users sometimes chose the Line + Symbol plot option because drop-lines weren't available for Line plots (addressed in Origin version 9.1+), do <i>not</i> set <b>Symbol Size</b> to <i>0</i>. Instead, follow the instructions in <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/How_to_add_drop_lines_to_line_plot.html" title="QuickHelp:How to add drop lines to line plot">this FAQ</a> for removing plot symbols from your Line + Symbol plot.</li></ul>
