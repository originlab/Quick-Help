<p>The embedded Python in Origin includes all the basic modules. But if you have other Python extension(s) installed (e.g. PyQt4) and would like to access it from the embedded Python in Origin, you always need to add its installation folder to the system path list before you import it.
</p><p>For an example on adding the installation folder to system path list, you may refer to the <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/Category/LT_Working_with_Python.html#A_Note_to_Use_Python_Extensions"><b>A Note to Use Python Extensions</b></a><b> section in the </b>Working with Python<b> chapter in LabTalk Guide.</b>
