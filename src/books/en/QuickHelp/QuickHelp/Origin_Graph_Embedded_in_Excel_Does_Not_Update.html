<h1 class="firstHeading">1.232 FAQ-1001 Origin Graphs copied to Excel do not update when changes are made in Origin</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Origin-Graph-Embedded-in-Excel-Does-Not-Update</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 3/26/2019</p>
<p>When you create a graph, click <b>Edit: Copy Page</b> and then paste to MS Excel (From the <b>Home</b> tab, click <b>Paste</b> or press CTRL+V), you are pasting an <i>editable</i> Origin object into your Excel file. Subsequently, you can double-click on the Origin object (graph), launch an OLE instance of Origin and make edits to your graph. Then from Origin's <b>File</b> menu, you click <b>Exit and Return to <i>Book</i></b> and the graph in Excel should update to show your edits.
</p><p>On some systems, the Origin graph embedded in Excel fails to update. When this happens, we suggest the following workarounds:
</p>
<ul><li> Try saving and reopening the Excel file. The graph should now show your updates.</li>
<li> Alternately, once you have made your edits in the OLE instance of Origin, repeat <b>Edit: Copy Page</b> on the updated graph, then paste the graph once again to Excel, replacing the OLE object that you previously added to the book.</li></ul>
