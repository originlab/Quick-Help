<h1 class="firstHeading">5.36 FAQ-737 How do I exchange files between Mac and Windows when running Origin on Mac?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Exchange-Files-between-Mac-and-Win</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 6/16/2015</p>
<p>Just drag-and-drop the file between the Mac and Windows partitions! The virtual machine creates a copy when a file is dragged and dropped in either direction. You could thus easily open an OPJ by dragging and dropping the file from a Mac folder right onto the Origin workspace. Similarly, you can export a graph from Origin to a folder in the Windows partition and then drag-and-drop the exported file to a Mac application for publication purposes.
</p><p>Please note, drag-and-drop is only supported by Parallel and VM Fusion; not supported in Virtual box, Wine and crossover.
