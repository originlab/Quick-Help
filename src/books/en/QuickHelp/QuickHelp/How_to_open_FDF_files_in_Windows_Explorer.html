<p>If you have the Adobe Acrobat Reader installed on your computer, Origin function definition files (.FDF) may display with an Adobe Acrobat Reader icon next to them. If you double-click on the file, Acrobat Reader attempts to open the file and fails. In order to open the file in a text editor, you can right-click on the file, select <b>Open With</b> from the shortcut menu. You can select Notepad or any other text editor from the associated dialog box.
</p><p>Note: There is also a check box in this dialog box which allows you to always open files of this type using the specified application.
