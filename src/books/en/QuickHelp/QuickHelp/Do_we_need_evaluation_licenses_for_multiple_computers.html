<p>You can use the same installer to install the trial version on each computer.  Once you start the trial on one computer and use the licensing dialog to obtain a trial license, you can use that trial license on all of the other computers.  On the other computers, select the "I already have a trial license" option in the dialog that opens at start up.  Make sure to enter the email address to which the original trial license was sent.
