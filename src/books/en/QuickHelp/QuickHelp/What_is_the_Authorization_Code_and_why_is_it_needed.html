<h1 class="firstHeading">6.23 FAQ-26 What is the Authorization Code and why is it needed?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Authorization-Code</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 10/14/2016</p>
<p>The Authorization Code is an eight character code used to notify the OriginLab website that you are requesting a license. When using the licensing dialog box to license Origin, the Authorization Code is passed automatically to the OriginLab website for license generation. However for manual license retrieval (such as for computers with no internet access), you must enter this Authorization Code when requesting the license.
