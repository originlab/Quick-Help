<h1 class="firstHeading">2.96 FAQ-969 What’s the difference between "Save Import setting to Sheet" and "save to &lt;sheet&gt;" in the import dialog?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Save-to-Sheet-Theme-Diff</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 9/19/2018</p>
<p>You may notice that there are two similar options in the <b>Dialog Theme</b> fly-out menu to save your import settings to sheet, When importing data using the import dialog. For example, when you import an ASCII file by <b>ImpASC</b> dialog and click the triangle button to the right of <b>Dialog Theme</b>, you will find these two menu items:
</p>
<ul><li> Save Import setting to Sheet</li>
<li> Save to &lt;sheet&gt;</li></ul>
<p><span class='headerInParagraph'>What’s the difference between these two?</span>
</p><p>“Save to &lt;sheet&gt;” saves your import settings to a X-Function dialog theme, which can be re-loaded when you use this X-Function to import. However, if you don’t use X-Function, for example, drag-n-drop a data file to import, the settings cannot be used. 
</p><p>On the other hand, “Save Import setting to Sheet” is introduced to cover this shortfall. It saves the import settings to a page filter which can be auto used when drag-n-drop a file to the workbook window.
