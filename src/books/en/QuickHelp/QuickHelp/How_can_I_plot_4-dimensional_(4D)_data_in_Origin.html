<h1 class="firstHeading">1.62 FAQ-184 How can I plot 4-dimensional (4D) data in Origin</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Plot-4D-Data</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/18/2019</p>
<p>If you have 4 columns of data that you wish to plot, you could plot the first 3 as an XYZ scatter and then use the 4th column to set the symbol color. 
</p>
<ol><li>Set the third column as Z and then highlight this column and choose <b>Plot &gt; 3D&#160;: 3D Scatter</b>.</li>
<li>With the plot active, select <b>Format:Plot</b>, to open the Plot Details dialog.</li>
<li>Set the Symbol Color to Color Mapping and choose the 4th column from the list of columns. (<i>see note below</i>) </li></ol>
<p>You could take this one step further and also convert the XYZ data to a matrix and then plot as a wireframe plot through the scatter points.
</p>
<table class="note">

<tr>
<td><b>Note</b>
<p>You have three options for "Using Values in a Data Set to Control Data Plot Color":
</p>
<ol><li>Indexing: This option allows you to specify a data set whose values denote the order of colors (index number) in the Origin Color Palette. </li>
<li>Direct RGB: An RGB composite value is computed from triplet components of Red, Green, and Blue. The R, G, and B component values range from 0 to 255. </li>
<li>Color Mapping: With this option you create a mapping relationship between ranges of 2D Y values or 3D Z values and an associated scale of colors. The 2D Y values or 3D Z values are then used to determine the data point element colors in the data plot, based on the established color map.</li></ol>
</td></tr></table>
<p>Using other Indexing options you can extend this idea to represent up to 8 dimensions of data in your 3D XYZ Plot: 
</p>
<ol><li>The X data </li>
<li>The Y data </li>
<li>The Z data </li>
<li>Size - Select one of the col(Column_Name) options </li>
<li>Edge Color - Select one of the col(Column_Name) options(only for the 2D symbol type) </li>
<li>Fill Color - Select one of the col(Column_Name) options(only for the 2D symbol type) </li>
<li>Shape - Select one of the col(Column_Name) options (only for the 2D symbol type; the 3D symbol type only supports five shapes, doesn't support using dataset to specify the symbol shapes) </li>
<li>Interior - Select one of the col(Column_Name) options (only for the 2D symbol type) </li></ol>
<p>All additional columns must be to the immediate right of the Z column in your worksheet.
