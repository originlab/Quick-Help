<h1 class="firstHeading">6.28 FAQ-31 When I try to get a license, why do I see a message telling me the license has been upgraded and that licenses for previous versions are no longer available?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>License-Upgraded-Error-Message</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 7/5/2018</p>
<p>From Origin 2018, different versions share the same license so that no more such limitation. However, for Origin 2017 and previous versions, once a package has been upgraded and licensed/registered with the new version, no further licenses may be obtained for the previous versions.
