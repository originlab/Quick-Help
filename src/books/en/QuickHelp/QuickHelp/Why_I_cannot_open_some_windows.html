<p>OriginLab makes available two low-cost/no-cost software products for students. Both are fully-functional versions of our OriginPro software, both are window-limited: 
</p>
<ul><li> The <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Products/OriginStudentVersion" target="_blank"><b>Student Version</b></a> has a limit of <i>30</i> accessible windows per Origin project. </li>
<li> The <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Products/OriginStudentVersion" target="_blank"><b>Learning Edition</b></a> - a product that is free to eligible users - has a limit of <i>12</i> accessible windows.</li></ul>
<p><br />
This limitation applies to windows of any type - workbook, matrixbook, graph, layout, notes etc. Windows beyond the limit number will not be accessible, but <i>will</i> be saved with the project.

<p><br />
Because these editions are window-limited, you may encounter the situation that some windows in your project are "locked": a lock icon shows on the window in the workspace and on the window icon in <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Project_Explorer.html"><b>Project Explorer</b></a> (you may also see a popup hint telling you that the maximum windows limit has been reached). 
</p><p>Consider splitting the project into several smaller projects. The easiest way to do that is to use <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/doc/Origin-Help/Project-Explorer#Save_a_Portion_of_the_Project_as_a_New_Project_File" target="_blank"><b>Project Explorer</b></a> to divide windows into folders of no more than 12 windows (Learning Edition) or 30 windows (Student Version). Then, right-click on the folder and select <b>Save as Project</b> to save it as a separate project.
