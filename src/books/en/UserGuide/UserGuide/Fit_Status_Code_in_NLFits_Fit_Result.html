<p>Fit may have converged, the number of parameters is greater than or equal to the number of input data and results are unreliable.

<p>-201 
</p>
</td>

<p>Fit did not converge because of poor data or parameter initialization. 
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The initial values are too far away from the real ones. Try to find some empirical values from papers or simulate a curve to estimate the initial value (<b>Analysis: Fitting: Simulate Curve</b>). You may need to re-define the function because the model does not seem to match the data. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>-202 
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Fit may have converged, because it cannot find direction to change parameters to reduce Chi-square. 
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This could be caused by "too perfect" initial values or over-parameterized/improper model. Try to adjust the initial values or fix one or two parameters. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>-203 
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Fit did not converge, because mutual dependency exists between parameters.
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The model is over-parameterized, so the fitter cannot find a fixed parameter value. Try simplifying the function, or fixing several parameter values. 
</p>
</td></tr>

<p>-204 
</p><p>-205 
</p><p>-206

<p>Fit did not converge, for some other unknown reason(s).
