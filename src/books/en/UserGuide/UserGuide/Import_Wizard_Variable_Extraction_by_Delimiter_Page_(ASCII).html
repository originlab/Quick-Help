<p>This page is available only if <b>Specify location of variable names and values using delimiters</b> is selected on the <b><a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Import_Wizard_Variable_Extraction_Page_(ASCII).html" title="UserGuide:Import Wizard Variable Extraction Page (ASCII)">Variable Extraction</a></b> page (and there is at least one header line in your data file). Use the controls on this page to extract variables from the file path/filename and file header information by parsing the information using one or more user-specified delimiters.

<h2><a name="Variables_Preview_Window"></a><span class="mw-headline">Variables Preview Window</span></h2>
<p>Use this preview window to select variables for extraction. The contents of this preview window include four standard file name variables (path + filename.extension, path, filename.extension, filename). Also included are any file header lines that were identified on the <b><a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Import_Wizard_Header_Lines_Page_(ASCII).html" title="UserGuide:Import Wizard Header Lines Page (ASCII)">Header Lines</a></b> page. Each variable name/value is preceded by a line number -- the <b>Line</b> value in the <b>Variable</b> group (see below).
</p>
<h2><a name="Variable_Group_Controls"></a><span class="mw-headline">Variable Group Controls</span></h2>
<p>Each line of information in the variable preview window is presumed to contain variables and variable values (you decide which is which). Note that each of the following can be chosen independently from each line in the preview window.

<tr>
<th> Enter variable name
</th>
<td> Variable names can be specified in two ways. Select this radio button to enter a string constant (spaces and special characters not allowed) to be used as the variable name. To extract the variable name from the information contained in the <b>Variables</b> preview window, select the <b>Extract variable name from file</b> radio button (next option).

<th> Extract variable name from file
</th>
<td> When you select this radio button, additional fields are added to the <b>Extraction by Delimiter </b>page. These fields allow you to specify a <b>Line</b>, <b>Delimiter(s)</b>, and <b>Name</b> for a given variable. This radio button is used to assign names to selections from the <b>Value</b> drop-down list.
