<h1 class="firstHeading">19.1.8 The Peak Analyzer Themes</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>PeakAnalyzer-Theme</p>
<p><br />
The <b>Dialog Theme</b> control in the upper panel of the <b>Peak Analyzer</b> allows you to save and load themes. You can save the current settings in the wizard or a subset of it as a theme. Next time you want to use the <b>Peak Analyzer</b> to perform analysis with similar options, you can load the settings from the theme to use the saved options again. Note that theme loading has to be done in the <b>Start</b> page, while theme saving can be done on any pages of the <b>Peak Analyzer</b>.
</p><p>A <b>Dialog Theme</b> for the <b>Peak Analyzer</b> consists of properties from all pages for the current <b>Goal</b>. A <b>Theme Setting</b> dialog limits the number of properties that are saved in the Theme file. Some hints are provided in the <b>Theme Setting</b> dialog to help determine when an option is appropriate.

<h3><a name="Dialog_Theme_Context_Menu"></a><span class="mw-headline">Dialog Theme Context Menu</span></h3>
<p>Clicking the triangle button to the right of <b>Dialog Theme</b> brings up a context menu:
</p>
<ul><li><b>Save as &lt;default&gt;</b> The current settings become the default start-up Theme for the Peak Analyzer</li>
<li><b>Save</b> Save the current settings to the current Dialog Theme</li>
<li><b>Save As...</b> Save the current settings to a new or existing Theme</li>
<li><b>Theme Setting...</b> Open the Theme Setting dialog</li>
<li><b>System Default</b> Reload Origin's original default Peak Analyzer Theme</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> Opens a dialog that lets you Delete Themes</li>
<li><b>Compare</b> (Advanced) Compare current Theme settings to a selected Theme. Output to Messages Log.</li>
<li><b>&lt;default&gt;</b> Load the Default Theme (which would be the System Default unless you have used <b>Save as &lt;default&gt;</b>)</li>
<li><b>&lt;Last used&gt;</b> Load the Theme settings automatically saved by Origin the last time you used Peak Analyzer.</li></ul>
<p>Previously saved Themes appear below <i>&lt;Last used&gt;</i>.
</p>
<h3><a name="Theme_Setting"></a><span class="mw-headline">Theme Setting</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Theme Setting</b> dialog gives you control over specific properties of a Peak Analyzer Theme. If the current settings of the Peak Analyzer make use of a property which is important to the Goal, you should make sure the appropriate boxes are checked to include those properties as part of the Theme.
</p><p>For example, if using Linear Constraints is important to a Fit, then <b>Enable Linear Constraints Status</b> should be checked (checked by default beginning with Origin 2021) and the <b>Enable Constraints</b> check box on the <b>Fit Control</b> tab of the <b>Peak Fit Parameters</b> dialog should be checked.
Conversely, if a setting in the Peak Analyzer should not be saved as part of the Theme file, you should uncheck that option here.
</p><p>The <b>Theme Setting</b> dialog appears when you select it from the Dialog Theme context menu and all its properties are included in the <b>Theme Save as...</b> dialog when you select <b>Save As...</b>.
