Most users will not need to concern themselves with these controls. However, if you have a worksheet with sharply-contrasting cell sizes and you want to make some global adjustment so that all cells show full contents, the strategy that seems to work best is to set <b>Min Height</b> and <b>Max Height</b> to <b>-1</b>, then set <b>Max Width</b> so that the cell with the largest content displays all contained data. Click <b>Resize Cells to Fit Content</b> and check to see that the cell contents display properly.
