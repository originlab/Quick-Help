<p>Origin's programming language is called <b>Origin C</b>.  Origin C supports a nearly complete ANSI C language syntax as well as a subset of C++ features including internal and DLL-extended classes.  In addition, Origin C is "Origin aware".  This means that Origin objects such as worksheets and graphs are mapped to classes in Origin C, allowing direct manipulation of these objects and their properties from Origin C.  
</p><p>Origin C's <b>integrated development environment</b> (<b>IDE</b>) is called <b>Code Builder</b>.  Code Builder provides tools for writing, compiling, and debugging your Origin C functions.  Once an Origin C function is compiled, the function becomes accessible from Origin.
