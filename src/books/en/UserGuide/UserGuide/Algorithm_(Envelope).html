<p>Origin detects the envelopes in the following steps:
</p>
<ol><li>Find out all the points whose first-order derivative is equal to zero in the source data. These points will be called the extreme values.</li>
<li>Perform cubic spline interpolation through these extreme values.</li>
<li>Smooth the interpolated data. The smoothing method employed here is Adjacent-Averaging, which takes the average of a certain number of data points around each point in original data. For more information about the smoothing method, please refer to the algorithm description of <a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Algorithm_(Smooth).html#The_adjacent-averaging_method" title="UserGuide:Algorithm (Smooth)">the Adjacent-Averaging method</a>.</li></ol>
