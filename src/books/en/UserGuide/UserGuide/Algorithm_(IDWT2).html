<p>Similar to 2D wavelet decomposition, dwt2 is separable; thus it can broken down to a series of 1D filtering and upsampling operations, as shown in the diagram below:

<p>Note that the filters used for reconstruction are determined by the chosen wavelet and the computation is implemented with a NAG function: nag_idwt2( ).
