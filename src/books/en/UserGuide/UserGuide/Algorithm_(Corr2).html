<p>2D Correlation is typically used to detect similarities between two 2D signals, which are often saved in matrices. The 2D correlation of two matrices, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>, can be defined as follows:

</p><p>There are two methods for 2D correlation computation: FFT and Shift-Accumulation. If shift accumulation is chosen, the result will be computed from the definition of correlation. If FFT is chosen, the computation of 2D correlation is actually carried out as follows:
</p>
<ol><li>The discrete Fourier transforms of both 2D signals are computed using 2D FFT.</li>
<li> Multiply the Fourier coefficients of the first signal with the conjugated coefficients of the second signal.</li>
<li>Perform inverse discrete Fourier transform on the product.</li></ol>
<p>Generally speaking, the FFT method can accelerate the computation for large data, but it is sometimes inaccurate for some data points near the boundaries due to the nature of FFT.
