<p>This page is available only if <b>Specify location of variable names and values using character positions</b> is selected on the <b><a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Import_Wizard_Variable_Extraction_Page_(ASCII).html" title="UserGuide:Import Wizard Variable Extraction Page (ASCII)">Variable Extraction</a></b> page (and there is at least one header line in your data file).

<h2><a name="Variables_Preview_Window"></a><span class="mw-headline">Variables Preview Window</span></h2>
<p>Use this preview window to select variables for extraction.  The content of this preview window includes four standard file name variables (<b>path + filename.extension, path, filename.extension, filename</b>).  Also included are any file header lines that were identified on <a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Import_Wizard_Header_Lines_Page_(ASCII).html" title="UserGuide:Import Wizard Header Lines Page (ASCII)">the Header Lines page</a>. Each variable name/value is preceded by a line number -- the<b> Line</b> value in the <b>Variable</b> group (see below).
</p>
<h2><a name="Variable_Group_Controls"></a><span class="mw-headline">Variable Group Controls</span></h2>
<p>Each line of information in the variable preview window is presumed to contain variables and variable values (you decide which is which).  Note that each of the following can be chosen independently from each line in the preview window.

These fields allow you to specify a <b>Line</b>, <b>Start</b> and <b>End</b> character positions, and <b>Name</b> for a given variable (the<b> Name</b> field is automatically filled using the specified character position information).  This option is used to assign a <b>Name</b> to the <b>Value</b> drop-down list.
