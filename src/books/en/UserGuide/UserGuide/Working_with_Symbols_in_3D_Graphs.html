<h1 class="firstHeading">9.3.6.1 Working with Symbols in 3D Graphs</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Sym-in-3DGraph</p>
<p>The <span class="db">Plot Details</span> dialog box for 3D scatter and trajectory graphs also includes the option to display XY, ZX, and YZ projections of the (original) 3D data plot.  
</p><p>To project data onto the XY, ZX, or YZ plane:
</p>
<ol><li>With your 3D scatter or trajectory graph active, select <span class="menu">Format: Plot</span> from the Origin menu.  This opens the <b>Symbol</b> tab of the <span class="db">Plot Details</span> dialog box.</li>
<li>Select the check box associated with the projection icon, in the left side of the <span class="db">Plot Details</span> dialog box.

<li>Click <b>Apply</b> or <b>OK</b> to project the original plot onto the selected plane.</li></ol>
<p>You can control the symbol attributes of projected plots just as you can the symbol attributes of the original plot.  This includes the option to select the <b>Show Construction</b> check box with all of the associated symbol construction options.
</p><p>Whenever the data plot icon is selected on the left side of the dialog box, an <b>Edit Control</b> tab displays.  The <b>Edit Control</b> tab is provided so that you can display projections in your 3D scatter or trajectory graph, and quickly control their display based on your original 3D data plot settings.  Alternatively, you can use this dialog box for custom edit control.

<ul><li>Select <b>All Together</b> to display and edit the settings on the (<span class="db">Plot Details</span>) <b>Line</b>, <b>Symbol</b>, and <b>Drop Lines</b> tabs for the 3D data plot (original) and the three projections.  </li>
<li>Select <b>Fully Independent</b> to edit each of the 3D data plot elements (original, XY, ZX, and YZ) separately. </li>
<li>Select <b>Original Independent of Projections</b> to edit the 3D data plot (original) element separate from the projections.</li></ul>

<p><b>Note:</b> When you select a data plot element icon on the left side of the dialog box, be careful not to inadvertently clear the icon's check box.  To activate the tabs of a data plot element icon with a selected check box, click on the text next to the icon, not in the check box.
