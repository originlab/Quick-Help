<h1 class="firstHeading">18.12.6.2 Algorithms (Multi-Scale Wavelet Decomposition)</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>MDWT-Algorithm</p>
<p>The multi-scale wavelet decomposition is actually comprised of a series of 1D wavelet decomposition. The computation of 1D wavelet decomposition in Origin is implemented with a NAG function: nag_dwt().
