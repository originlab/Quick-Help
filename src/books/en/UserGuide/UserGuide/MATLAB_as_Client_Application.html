<p>If you use MATLAB, you can now use Origin's Automation Server support to automatically generate publication-quality graphs using your MATLAB data. For example*, you can create a simple routine that performs the following tasks:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Connect to the Origin server application</li>
<li>
Load a previously customized Origin Project file that includes a workbook and custom graph</li>
<li>
Send MATLAB data to the worksheet, thereby automatically updating the custom graph</li>
<li>
Rescale the graph</li>
<li>
Copy the graph image to the system clipboard</li>
</ul>

<dd><a  class="image"><img alt="MATLAB as Client 02.png" src="../images/MATLAB_as_Client_Application/MATLAB_as_Client_02.png?v=70665" width="518"  /></a></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Routines such as this are a great way to use Origin's project files as project templates. Once a project has been created to include a source workbook and custom graph, the project can be automatically updated and the result exported in the desired format without user intervention.
</p><p>To try this example in Origin, follow the instructions in the file called "CreatePlotInOrigin.m" located in 
<i><b>\Samples\COM Server and Client\MATLAB</b></i>.
</p>
<ul><li> Note: MATLAB must be installed on your computer. .</li></ul>
