<p>Once a saved project has been opened and updated, you can "clone" the project, and then use the cloned project file to repeat the operations involved, with other data or the same data but changed in future. We call this cloned project as an analysis template project, which means it can be used as a working routine just like the <a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Analysis_Templates.html" title="UserGuide:Analysis Templates">general analysis template</a>.

<dd>The current project name and full path are shown if it has been saved. You can choose to
<ul><li>Add Data Connectors to the worksheets that have not connectors yet. Please note that <b>Add Connectors</b> is available only when the current project has been saved. The data source of the newly-added Data Connector is the current project file, just like you import the source data by selecting <b>Data: Connect to File: Origin File</b>.</li>
<li>Clear all data or just the imported data (including data imported by selecting the menu <b>Data: Import from File</b>).</li>
<li>If the current project contains recalculation, you can choose to delete the re-calculable columns or set the recalculation to None.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>This will create and open a duplicate of the existing project named <i>UNTITLED.opju</i>, in which all the windows and operations in the original project are kept. At the same time, all the imported data will be cleared but the connection between the data source and the destination worksheet will be kept. You can then simply update the data source, and all the worksheets and graphs are automatically updated.

<h2><a name="Project_Backup_and_Recovery"></a><span class="mw-headline">Project Backup and Recovery</span></h2>
<p>Origin has three different data recovery features which can be enabled or disabled from <b>Preference: Options</b>:
</p>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><a  class="image"><img alt="Project recovery tools options.png" src="../images/Opening_Closing_and_Backing_Up_the_Origin_Project_File/Project_recovery_tools_options.png?v=79126" width="620"  /></a></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ol><li> <b>Backup</b> is the oldest Origin recovery feature and can be useful for recovering data when you have a project file that will not open. This file should contain the project content at the moment of the last successful file save.</li>
<li> <b>Autosave</b> is useful for recovering from program crashes and power failures. The file is automatically saved at some predefined interval (by default, every 12 minutes).</li>
<li> <b>Unsaved</b> is useful for recovering data that you declined to save on closing the file or the program (both Untitled and named files).</li></ol>
<h3><a name="New_Projects"></a><span class="mw-headline">New Projects</span></h3>
<p>By default when you launch Origin, the Origin window title shows <b>UNTITLED</b> to indicate a blank new project. This file remains named as UNTITLED until you choose <b>File: Save Project</b> or <b>File: Save Project As</b>. In either case, attempting to save UNTITLED will open the Save As dialog box where you can choose a path, a <b>File name</b> and a file type (<b>Save as type</b>).
</p>
<h3><a name="Autosave_Unsaved_Project"></a><span class="mw-headline">Autosave Unsaved Project</span></h3>
<p>If you make some modification to an open project - be it a named project or UNTITLED -- a star character ("*") will show next to the file name in the Origin title bar.

<p>Once a file has been modified, attempting to close the file or exit Origin before choosing <b>File: Save Project</b> or <b>File: Save Project as</b>,  will trigger a prompt to save changes to the project.

<p>Beginning with Origin 2018, if you say NO and (1) <b>Autosave Unsaved Project</b> is enabled (default) and (2) the project file size is less than the value of LabTalk system variable <b>@USM</b> (default = <i>20MB</i>), the project file will be saved automatically before closing (see <a href="#Notes_on_Unsaved_Projects"><b>Notes</b></a>).

<ul><li> The maximum size for unsaved files is controlled by LabTalk System Variable <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#U.2CV.2CW"><b>@USM</b></a>. By default, @USM is set to 20MB; unsaved files larger than the @USM threshold will NOT be saved if you exit without saving. </li>
<li> There can be only one \Unsaved\UNTITLED file. If you decide to recover the contents of UNTITLED, you should open and immediately save the file with a meaningful name, as UNTITLED will be overwritten if you start another unnamed project and fail to save on close or program exit.</li>
<li> By default, Unsaved Files are kept for 7 days, after which they are discarded. The "keeping time" is controlled by LabTalk System Variable <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#U.2CV.2CW"><b>@USKT</b></a>.</li></ul>

<p>Origin also has an <b>Autosave project every <i>xx</i> minute(s)</b> feature that is turned on by default. When enabled, project contents are saved at a <a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_(Options)_Open_Close_Tab.html#Additional_Controls" title="UserGuide:The (Options) Open Close Tab">user-controlled time interval</a>, to a temporary file in the user's \Documents\OriginLab\Autosave folder. During the session, named files will list in the \Autosave folder as <i>projectFilenNme</i>-<i>xxxxxxxxx</i>. UNTITLED projects will list as UNTITLED-<i>xxxxxxxxx</i>. 
If you save an Origin project and exit the program normally, Origin "cleans up" by deleting these temporary files. If a named and modified project, or an UNTITLED project, is closed without saving, the most recent autosaved file will be saved to Autosave\Last-AutoSave.opj(u). 
</p><p>In the event of a program crash, both named and UNTITLED files should be preserved in their last autosaved state, as <i>projectFilenNme</i>-<i>xxxxxxxxx</i> and UNTITLED-<i>xxxxxxxxx</i>, respectively. By default, these files will be kept for only 12 hours so it is best to try and recover contents immediately (see <a href="#Notes_on_Autosave_Project"><b>Notes</b></a>).
</p>
<ul><li> Autosave is turned on by default for UNTITLED projects as well as named projects.</li>
<li> If you opt not to save an UNTITLED project, project contents are written to a file named as <i>Last-AutoSave.opj(u).</i> As with \Backup\UNTITLED.OPJ(U), there can be only one file named as <i>Last-AutoSave.opj(u).</i></li>
<li> To disable autosave for UNTITLED projects, set <a class="external text" href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/How_do_I_permanently_change_the_value_of_a_system_variable.html"><b>@DASU</b>=<i>1</i></a>.  </li></ul>
<p><br />
<span class='headerInParagraph'>To open the autosaved file:</span>
</p>
<ol><li> Locate the Autosave folder by one of the following:
<ul><li> Select <b>Help: Open Folder: Autosave</b> menu to open the folder.</li>
<li> Open <b>Preference: Options...</b>. The <b>System Path</b> tab lists all paths created by Origin, including <b>Autosave</b> (Note that, on this tab, you can modify the location of your Autosave folder by highlighting <b>Autosave</b> and then clicking the <b>Change...</b> button).</li></ul></li>
<li> Open Last-AutoSave.opju/opj. by (a) double-clicking on the project icon in Windows File Explorer, (b) use Origin's <b>File: Open...</b> menu command or (c) drag and drop the file onto your Origin workspace.</li></ol>
<h4><a name="Controlling_Autosave_settings"></a><span class="mw-headline">Controlling Autosave settings</span></h4>
<p>To enable or disable this periodic autosave feature, or to adjust the period of time between autosaves:

<ul><li> If the current project size exceeds 20MB (by default, and controlled by "@" System Variable <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#A"><b>@ASC</b></a>), autosaving will trigger the following attention dialog box:</li></ul>

<ul><li> Since autosaving of files can slow your work, this dialog box serves to allow you to turn off autosave for the current project or for any project larger than the threshold size. <i><b>Do this only upon careful consideration</b></i>.</li>
<li> The time period that an Autosaved (crashed) project is kept is controlled by an "@" System Variable <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#A"><b>@ASKH</b></a>. By default those "keeping hours" = 12, but you can change this value in the Script Window (<b>Window: Script Window</b>).

If, for some reason, you find that you cannot open a saved project (or it opens but you find that it is somehow corrupted), you should be able to roll back to the previously-saved version of the file by opening the file at \Backup. This feature is enabled by default and is independent of the "Autosave" and "Unsaved" features.
