<p>With RGB values, a graphical representation of an image's tonal ranges (from pure black to pure white) will show that the black and white points represent different colors in different channels.
</p><p>For instance: in the <b>red channel</b>, a black point will represent cyan whereas a white point represents red. Likewise, in a <b>green channel</b>, a black point represents magenta and a white point represents green. And lastly, in a <b>blue channel</b>, a black point represents yellow with a white point representing blue.
</p><p>In the <a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/ImgBalance.html">imgBalance</a>X-Function, we can adjust the coordinates of the color level in all channels (R, G &amp; B) to modify the image color.
