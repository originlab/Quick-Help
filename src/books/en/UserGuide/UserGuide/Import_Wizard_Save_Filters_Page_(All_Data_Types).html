<p><span class="db">Import Wizard</span> settings can be saved to a filter file for future use with the same file or with files of the same type.  The filter file can be saved to one of three general locations. You can use wild cards when assigning a data file name for use with your import filter. This allows you to associate the filter with a group of related data files.

<p>Select this check box to save the <span class="db">Import Wizard</span> settings to a filter file.

<th> In the Data File Folder
</th>
<td>
<p>When selected, the filter file is saved in the same folder where the imported data file is saved.  
</p><p>Use this option if you want to keep similar data files in your folders; you can define a filter that can apply to all files in your folder.  When the wizard is used to import the same file or similar files from the same subfolder, the wizard will give preferentially choose matching filter files in the data folder. 
</p><p>Additionally, during drag-and-drop importing process Origin will automatically use suitable filters found in the same folder as the data file.  If the data folder has multiple filters that are suitable for the file being dropped, Origin will prompt you for the preferred filter file.
</p>

<th> In the User Files Folder
</th>

<p>If selected, the filter file is saved to the \Filters subfolder in the User Files area. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th> In the Window
</th>
<td>
<p>If selected, the filter is saved to the worksheet.  You then save the worksheet as a template (*.OTW) and the filter information becomes part of the template.  If the worksheet has a filter saved in it, when the <span class="db">Import Wizard</span> is invoked with such a worksheet active, the <b>Filter</b> drop-down on the first page will list the option "<b>&lt;User filter in active window&gt;</b>".
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th> Show Filter in File: Open Dialog
</th>
<td>
<p>This option is enabled only when <b>In the User Files Folder</b> is selected.  If this check box is selected, the <b>File Types</b> drop-down in the <b>File:</b> <span class="db">Open</span> dialog will list the filter by name, along with the chosen wild card specification.  This option provides the users with a way to add custom file types to the <b>File:</b> <span class="db">Open</span> dialog.
</p>
</td></tr></table>
<h2><a name="Filter_Description"></a><span class="mw-headline">Filter Description</span></h2>
<p>Enter the description for the filter in this text box.  The description will be displayed when you choose this filter in the <b>Source</b> page of the <span class="db">Import Wizard</span>.
</p><p>This is optional. You could just leave this text box empty.
</p>
<h2><a name="Filter_File_Name"></a><span class="mw-headline">Filter File Name</span></h2>
<p>Name the filter file (the .OIF extension is automatically appended). 
</p><p>This control is not available when the <b>In the Window</b> option is chosen.  In the other two cases (where the filter is saved to a disk file), the filter files are saved with an OIF (Origin Import Filter) extension, in the XML format.  The files are editable with a text editor such as <span class="program">Notepad</span> and can be viewed with any application that supports the XML format (such as <span class="win">Internet Explorer</span>).
</p>
<h2><a name="Specify_Data_File_Names_to_Which_This_Filter_Will_Be_Associated"></a><span class="mw-headline">Specify Data File Names to Which This Filter Will Be Associated</span></h2>
<p>Use the <b>Applicable File</b> box to specify file types to which the saved filter should be applied.  Wildcards are useful for associating with a family of similarly-named files.
</p><p>Wildcard Examples: 
</p>
<ul><li>Specify a wildcard such as <i>*.txt</i> to apply to any file of extension <i>.txt</i>.</li>
<li>Specify a wildcard such as <i>Experiment*.txt</i> to apply to any file that begins with <i>Experiment</i>.</li>
<li> Specify a wildcard such as <i>s.???.dat</i> to apply to any .<i>dat</i> file that begins with <i>s</i>, followed by any three characters.</li>
<li>Specify multiple wildcards using a semicolon separator: <i>*.txt</i>;<i>*.dat</i>; <i>mydata*.*</i>, etc.  When you choose to import a file using the <span class="db">Import Wizard</span> (by any method including drag and drop), wildcards in all filters saved to User Files\Filters or the data folder are scanned to find those filters that match the name of the import file.</li></ul>
<h2><a name="Specify_Advanced_Filter_Options"></a><span class="mw-headline">Specify Advanced Filter Options</span></h2>
<p>If selected, the <b>Next</b> button is enabled and the <b>Advanced Options</b> page is added, in which you specify advanced filter options, such as a script to be executed at the end of the import process, etc.
</p><p>If left cleared, the <b>Next</b> button is disabled.  You then click <b>Finish</b> to complete data import.
