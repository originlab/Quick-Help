<p>Select this radio button if you want to save the Excel workbook internally to the project. After this radio button is selected and the project is saved, changes made to the Excel workbook in Origin will no longer affect the source Excel file. Changes made to the source Excel file will not affect the Excel workbook in the Origin project, either.   
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th> External
</th>
<td>
<p>Select this radio button if you want to save a link connecting the active Excel workbook and its source Excel file when the project is saved. After this radio button is selected, changes made to the Excel workbook in Origin will affect the source Excel file. Also, changes made to the source Excel file will affect the Excel workbook in the Origin project.   
</p><p>When this radio button is selected and the project is saved, changes made to the workbook in Origin are reflected in the original source workbook.  Additionally, changes made to the original source workbook file are reflected in the Origin project.
</p><p>When this radio button is selected, Origin displays the full path and file name of the linked source file in the <b>Linked File Path</b> field.

<tr>
<th> Do not save, open as ready-only
</th>
<td>
<p>This checkbox is available only when the <b>External</b> radio button is selected. When this check box is selected, the Excel workbook opened in Origin is ready-only. This means that changes made to the Excel workbook in Origin will not be saved to the source Excel file. However, changes made to the original source Excel file will be reflected in the linked Excel workbook in Origin.

<table class="dialogcontroltable">

<tr>
<th> Relative to current project (OPJ) path
</th>
<td>
<p>This checkbox specifies whether or not to save the location of the Excel file as a relative path to the current project file. For example, if the project file is saved to c:\ and the Excel file is c:\test\Data.xls, the relative path will be test\data.xls. Using relative path will increase the portability of the project and the Excel file. 
</p><p>When the <b>Switch to OPJ Path upon Saving</b> button is click, this checkbox is selected automatically. 
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<th> Switch to OPJ Path upon Saving
</th>
<td>
<p>Clicking this button will change the external Excelâ€™s path to the path of the current project (OPJ). If the original path of the Excel file is not the same as the project path, a new copy of the Excel file will be created in the project path when the project is saved.

<p>When you plot workbook data from multiple sheets, Origin uses <i><b>@SheetNumber</b></i> notations to denote these sheets that contain plotted data. To determine the numeric value of <i><b>SheetNumber</b></i>, Origin numbers the sheets in the order in which they are accessed for plotting. The workbook sheets and their associated <i><b>SheetNumber</b></i> values are listed in this list box.
