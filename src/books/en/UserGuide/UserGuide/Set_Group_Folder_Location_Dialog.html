<p>Origin users managed by all license types can use the Group Folder feature, where a group leader, or server machine, can share various Origin file types with multiple group members.

<p>Any files that need to be shared must be placed in the Group Folder. The user who operates the group leader machine must set the group folder location in Origin and notify all members of this location. Members are then required to set this location of the group folder with Origin installed on their machines. Otherwise, they cannot get the shared files. The group folder can be set at either a UNC path, such as a web-shared or local-shared folder accessible to the group leader machine and all the member machines, or a non-UNC path, such as a shared DropBox folder on the local machine that synchronizes in all group members' machines.   
</p><p>From version 2019b, Origin supports setting multiple group folders, which makes it possible to share different files between groups. A leader machine can setup multiple groups and publish different files to different groups. On the other hand, a member machine can belongs to multiple groups and thus receive all files these group leaders publish. 
</p><p><br />
To specify a folder as the Group folder, use the <b>Set Group Folder Location</b> dialog. This dialog can be opened by selecting <b>Preferences: Set Group Folder Location</b> from the Origin menu.
