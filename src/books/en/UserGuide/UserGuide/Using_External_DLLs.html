<p>(Advanced Option)
</p><p>The built-in Origin fitting function fits datasets with pre-compiled DLLs. If you are interested in improving the performance of your user-defined fitting function, you can create a fitting function using an external DLL. Fitting functions defined using an external DLL will work faster than those defined with Origin C.

<td><b>Note:</b> We have prepared an Origin package file, Fitting with External DLL.opx, in the \Samples\Curve Fitting folder. Drag-and-drop the .opx file into Origin workspace. A <i>Fitting with External DLL</i> folder will be created in your Origin User Files Folder (<b>Help: Open Folder: User Files Folder</b>). In the folder, there are Microsoft Visual C++ workspace and sample data files, plus instructions for creating such DLLs.
