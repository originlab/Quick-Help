<h1 class="firstHeading">27.7.5.3 The Master INI File</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Startup-MasterINI</p>
<p>Your Origin installation contains a number of INI files that control the configuration of some Origin feature, on startup.  For instance, the Origin default initialization file, ORIGIN.INI, presets a number of Origin options that remain active until you close the Origin session.  These options include the menu configuration and some display settings.  In a typical server + client installation or on a standalone installation of Origin with multiple users, each client/user will maintain a separate version of the INI file in the <b>User Files</b> folder.  This allows each client/user to customize Origin settings without overwriting the settings of other clients/users.  
</p><p>Unfortunately, the existence of multiple .INI files can present its own problems for the network administrator charged with maintaining or updating Origin for multiple users.  The <b>Master INI</b> file feature is designed to help alleviate some of the problems of maintaining multiple copies of system files for server + client and multi-user workstation installations.  
</p><p>The Master INI file works in the following way:
</p>
<ul><li>The Master INI file name must begin with an <b>"M"</b> (e.g. ORIGIN.INI becomes MORIGIN.INI; NLSF.INI becomes MNLSF.INI; etc.).</li></ul>
<ul><li>The Master INI file must be in the Origin root folder (in the folder with the Origin EXE).</li></ul>
<p>Should Origin detect the presence of a Master INI, on startup, it merges the Master INI file with the local INI file. If there is a key in Master INI file and no such key in local INI file, the key is created.  If there is key in Master that exists in local, the key in the local is overwritten.  
</p><p>When merging of files is complete, a time stamp with the Master INI's modification time is written to the local INI file. The next time that a client/user is launched, Origin compares the Master modification time with the time stamp written to the local INI file.  If the two are equal, no merging of INI files is done.  It is, therefore, possible to modify the local INI file to override Master INI settings.   If the Master INI is later modified, it is then merged with the local copy on client startup.
</p><p><i><b>Notes on Installing and Making OPX Tools Available to Clients/Users</b></i>
</p><p>The systems administrator should run Origin with the Origin root folder named as the <b>User Files</b> folder.  When the admin then <a class="external text" href="../../GettingStarted/OriginLab/Sharing_Origin_Files.html#Packaging_Files">installs the OPX file</a>, the contents are unpacked beneath the Origin root folder.  
</p><p>When a new toolbar is added by installing an OPX file, an entry is written to the ORIGIN.INI file in the root folder (same as the User Files folder, in this case). 
</p><p>For example:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #000000;">&#91;</span>UserDefinedButtons<span style="color: #000000;">&#93;</span> 

User Defined<span style="color: #000080;">=</span>Oubtn.<span style="color: #000080;">ini</span> 

Script Toolbar<span style="color: #000080;">=</span>OSCRIPTTOOLBAR.<span style="color: #000080;">INI</span></pre>
<p>This systems administrator should add this to entry to MORIGIN.INI, to ensure toolbar access to all clients/users.
