<h1 class="firstHeading">19.1.2 The Peak Analyzer Dialog Box</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>PeakAnalyzer-Dialog</p>
<p><br />
The <b>Peak Analyzer</b> dialog box contains two panels (see the screenshot below): the upper panel and the lower panel.
</p><p>The upper panel has a <b>Dialog Theme</b> control and a wizard map. The former allows you to load the settings from an existing theme or save the current settings as a theme file for future use. The wizard map, on the other hand, can be used to navigate through different pages of the wizard: you can click the page icons on the wizard map to go to any page. Note that the wizard map are color-coded to indicate the active page (green), a page that has not been visited (yellow), a page that has already been visited (orange), and the last wizard page (red). 
</p><p>The lower panel of the <b>Peak Analyzer</b> is used for tweaking the options for the analysis in each page of the wizard. The <b>Peak Analyzer</b> is actually a wizard that threads together a few X-Functions. Depending on the active page, different X-Function will be rendered in the lower panel. You can use the controls in the panel to choose the computation options.
</p><p>There are a few buttons between the panels. The <b>Prev</b> and <b>Next</b> buttons are used to switch between different pages of the wizard. The <b>Finish</b> button allows you to skip all later pages and complete the whole analysis with the settings in the current theme file. The <b>Cancel</b> button, on the other hand, closes the <b>Peak Analyzer</b> without performing the analysis. The <b>Hide Top/Show Top</b> button toggles the upper panel on and off, while the <b>Hide XF/Show XF</b> button can be used to hide or show the lower panel.
