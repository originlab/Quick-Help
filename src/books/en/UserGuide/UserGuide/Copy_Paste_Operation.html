<p>When finishing a certain kind of fitting analysis process for a plot, and you want to apply this similar analysis process to other plot(s) in the same graph or other graphs in the same project, copy/paste operation can offer a flexible way to copy and paste fitting analysis operation at certain object according the click position.

<ul><li>Copy/paste operation can apply to various fitting analysises, including:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>Linear Fit</li>
<li>Nonlinear Curve/Implicit Curve/Surface Fit</li>
<li>Nonlinear Matrix Fit </li>
<li>Polynomial Fit</li>
<li>Other special nonlinear curve fitting operations(Exepential Fit/Single Peak Fit/Sigmoidal Fit)</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul><li>Dependent on where the click is, copy/paste operation can be applied  to following cases (with similar data source and type) in the same project range:</li></ul>
<dl><dd><ul><li>One plot in one layer</li>
<li>Grouped plots in one layer</li>
<li>All plots in one layer</li>
<li>All plots in one graph</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>When the fitting analysis is accomplished, The <b>Copy Operation</b> function can either be activated by clicking the green locks <a  class="image"><img alt="Copy Paste Operation 01.png" src="../images/Copy_Paste_Operation/Copy_Paste_Operation_01.png?v=37206" width="14"  /></a> of analysis report sheet or that of its relative fitting graph to open the context menu.But you can only paste the analysis operation into a graph.

<p>Paste operation function can be implemented in a flexible way, dependent of the target object type: 
</p>
<ul><li><b>One plot in one layer</b></li></ul>
<p>To paste operation to the single plot in one layer, Right-click on the data plot and select <b>Paste Operation</b> from the shortcut menu. When paste operation function is  succeeded, a green lock and a fitting line will appear on the plot. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>Grouped plots in one layer</b></li></ul>
<p>If a layer includes some grouped data plots and ungrouped plots and you want to paste operation to a grouped data plots, click to choose the grouped data points and select <b> Paste Operation</b> to applied the fitting analysis to the grouped data plots. In the following example, plot B and D is grouped together, but plot C is not in the group. Therefore, the analysis will only be pasted to plot B and D. When this paste operation function is  succeeded, two green locks and two fitting lines will appear on the plot.

<td><b>Note:</b> To apply the paste operation to only one of the grouped data plots, click twice to a data point of that specific curve and right click to open the shortcut menu to choose <b> Paste Operation</b>.

<ul><li><b>All plots in one layer</b></li></ul>
<p>When you want to apply the fitting analysis to all plots of a certain layer of a graph, including the grouped plots and ungrouped plots,  click the layer icon to choose a certain layer, then right click at the white area of the layer to open the short-cut menu and select <b>Paste Operation</b>. 
</p>
<ul><li><b>All plots in one graph</b></li></ul>
<p>Similarly, copy/paste operation can also be applied to all layers in one graph. Go to a multi-layer graph, right click on the white page area(without layer/data plots/axis being selected) to open the shortcut menu and choose <b>Paste Operation</b>.
