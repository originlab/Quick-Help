<h1 class="firstHeading">6.11 Customizing Data: Import from File and File: Export Menu</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Im-Export-Menu-Customize</p>
<p><br />
As mentioned in the previous sections, you can select a file format from the <i>Import from File'</i> menu to run the X-Function that imports files of the specified format.  Similarly, the <b>Export</b> menu can be used to export the active matrix, worksheet, or graph to a chosen format.  
</p><p>These two menus are constructed dynamically when Origin starts up, by scanning the X-Functions in following two folders:
</p><p>1. The \<b>Import and Export</b> subfolder of the \<b>X-Functions</b> folder in the Origin program folder.
</p><p>2. The \<b>Import and Export</b> subfolder of the \<b>X-Functions</b> folder in the user files folder.
</p><p>The X-Functions in these two folders are listed in either of the menus, depending on their filenames:
</p><p>1. Those that begin with "imp" are put in the <b>Data&#160;: Import from File</b> menu. 
</p><p>2. Those that start with "exp" are listed in the <b>File&#160;: Export</b> menu.  
</p><p><br />
The scanning of the X-Functions is performed every time Origin starts up.  Therefore, if the X-Functions in the \<b>Import and Export</b> folder are changed, you will see the updates on the <b>Data&#160;: Import from File</b> and <b>File&#160;: Export</b> menus next time you start Origin.
