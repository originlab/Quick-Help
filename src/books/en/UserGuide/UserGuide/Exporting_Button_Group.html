<p>When you <a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/User_Defined_and_Custom_Toolbars_and_Toolbar_Buttons.html#Method_1:_Create_a_new_button_group" title="UserGuide:User Defined and Custom Toolbars and Toolbar Buttons">create a custom toolbar button group</a>, you can easily share your custom button group with another Origin user. This exchange is accomplished by exporting your custom files to a special file with an .OPX extension, and then sending that file to the intended Origin user (Note that you cannot install OPX files on Origin versions prior to 8.0). For example, if you were to use Origin to create an X-Function and a button from a custom button group to open this X-Function in Origin, you could then share the button group and associated files with any other Origin user. 
</p><p>Installation of the OPX file is simple: the Origin user simply drags the .OPX file onto their Origin program button on the taskbar or onto their Origin program window (or they can double-click on the OPX file), and the your custom files are automatically unpacked to the correct location.

<p>When creating a custom button group for export to an .OPX file, consider saving your button group's initialization file, bitmap file(s), script file(s), and any other support files to a user-created subfolder in your <a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_User_Files_Folder.html" title="UserGuide:The User Files Folder"><b>User Files Folder</b> (UFF)</a>. When another Origin user installs your .OPX file, your custom subfolder will automatically be created in the user's UFF, and this subfolder will contain the files for the custom button group. This allows you to keep your custom files separate from other Origin files. This is particularly helpful if your end user happens to install multiple .OPX files. 
</p><p>To export your custom button group (or the User Defined button group) to an .OPX file: 
</p>
<ol><li>From the menu, choose <b>View: Toolbars</b> to open the <b>Customize Toolbar</b> dialog box. </li>
<li>Select the <b>Button Groups</b> tab. </li>
<li>Select your custom button group from the <b>Groups</b> list box. </li>
<li>Click the <b>Export</b> button in the <b>Button Group</b> group. This opens the <b>Export Button Group</b> dialog box. The upper view box lists the files that will be exported to the .OPX file when you click Export. By default, this view box lists the initialization file and the bitmap file for the custom button group, and the LabTalk script files associated with the buttons in the group. </li>
<li>If you want to add additional files with this dialog box: 
<dl><dd><ol><li>Click the <b>Add File</b> button. This opens the<b> Open</b> dialog box. </li>
<li>Select additional files. Additional files are displayed in the <b>Additional Files</b> view box. Note that it is not recommended to include files that are located outside your user files folder. </li></ol></dd></dl></li>
<li>If you want to remove an additional file, select the file you want to remove, then click the Remove File button. </li>
<li>The <b>For Use By</b> drop-down list allows you to restrict installation of your .OPX file: 
<dl><dd><ul><li><b>All Users</b> allows anyone who receives your .OPX file to install your custom button group to their Origin folder (user must have version 8.0 or later). </li>
<li><b>Licensed Users</b> allows only licensed users to install your custom button group (excludes Evaluation software users). </li>
<li><b>Registered Users</b> allows only users who have registered and entered their Registration ID in their Origin software to install your custom button group. </li></ul></dd></dl></li>
<li>To complete the creation of your .OPX file, click the <b>Export</b> button. This opens the <b>Save As</b> dialog box. By default, Origin lists the custom button group name in the<b> File Name</b> text box. </li>
<li>Edit the file name and path, as needed*. </li>
<li>Click <b>Save</b> to create the .OPX file. </li></ol>

<p><b>*Note:</b> The file name extension must be .OPX. You do not need to enter this extension as Origin will add it automatically. If you enter an extension other than .OPX, .OPX will be appended on the file name.
