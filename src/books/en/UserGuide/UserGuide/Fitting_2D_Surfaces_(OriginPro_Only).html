<p>Origin supports 3D Surface Fitting, which is an extension of ordinary nonlinear fitting, for both XYZ and matrix data. The operation to perform a surface fit is similar to that of nonlinear fitting.

</p><p>Origin provides 22 <a href="../../UserGuide/Category/Non-linear_Surface_Fitting.html" title="Category:Non-linear Surface Fitting">built-in surface fitting functions</a>, such as Gauss2D, DoseReponse2D, Exponential2D, and Polynomial2D, or you can define your own function.

<h2><a name="Start_a_surface_fitting_session"></a><span class="mw-headline">Start a surface fitting session</span></h2>
<ul><li>Fit from a worksheet. You should specify XYZ range as input data, and then select <b>Analysis: Fitting: Nonlinear Surface Fit</b> to open the dialog.</li>
<li>Fit from a matrix. To open the dialog, select <b>Analysis: Nonlinear Matrix Fit</b> from menu when a matrix is active.</li>
<li>Fit from a 3D graph. You can fit the surface by selecting <b>Analysis: Fitting: Nonlinear Surface Fit</b> to open the dialog.</li></ul>
<p>Since there are two independent variables in surface fitting, a scatter plot cannot be used to represent the residual in a plane and a contour plot should be used instead. Please read the Residual Analysis chapter for more information.

<p>The surface fitting results can be plotted either as a 3D surface or 2D contour. If it is a 3D surface, it will be plotted based on OpenGL by default. You can click <a href="../../UserGuide/Category/3D_and_Contour_Graphing.html#Control_the_OpenGL_Status" title="Category:3D and Contour Graphing">here</a> to learn the method of controlling the OpenGL status.
</p><p>You can choose to add the fitted surface plot to source graph if you start the surface fit from a graph, this table below shows the difference between turning on and off OpenGL when adding fitted surface to source graph:
