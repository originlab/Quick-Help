<p>Data already existing in a worksheet can be reduced in size using various tools in Origin. The following table provides a summary of available tools. These tools are all accessible from the <b>Analysis: Data Manipulation</b> menu or <b>Worksheet</b> menu when a worksheet is active. Note that some of the tools are also available when a graph window is active.

<th> Description
</th></tr>
<tr>
<td> Reduce to Evenly Spaced X
</td>
<td> <a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/Reduce_ex.html">reduce_ex</a>
</td>
<td> Works on a single XY Curve. Allows creating reduced output with evenly spaced X values. Uses interpolation before reduction if input data is not evenly spaced.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Reduce Duplicate X Data
</td>
<td> <a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/Reducedup.html">reducedup</a>
</td>
<td> Works on a single XY Curve. Reduces all XY pairs where X values are duplicated, allowing for options on how to handle the Y values. See also the menu item <b>Worksheet: Remove Duplicated Rows</b> which works with text data as well.
</td></tr>

</td>
<td>
<p><b>wdelrows</b>:Works on all or partial columns of the worksheet. A specified number of rows will be skipped each time to reduce the data size.
</p><p><b>reducerows</b>:Works with a selection of columns. Replaces every N data points with specified basic statistics value such as average.  
</p><p><b>wreducerows</b>:Works on all or partial columns of the worksheet. This X-Function combines the features of <b>wdelrows</b> and reducerows<b>.</b>

<tr>
<td> Reduce Columns
</td>
<td>
<p><a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/Wreducecols.html">wreducecols</a>
</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Works on all or partial columns of the worksheet and reduces worksheet columns by deleting or statistically merging.
</p>
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td> Reduce by Group
</td>
<td> <a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/Reducexy.html">reducexy</a>
</td>
<td> Works on a single XY curve. Allows grouping the data by a number of groups, every N points, or by X increment, and then allows replacing X and Y by quantities such as mean, minimum and maximum. Merging Y values by averaging is sometimes referred to as "Boxcar Averaging."
