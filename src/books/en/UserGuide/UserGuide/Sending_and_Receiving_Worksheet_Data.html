<h1 class="firstHeading">25.2.3 Sending and Receiving Worksheet Data</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Mathematica-Send-Receive-WksData</p>
<p>You can send and receive data between an Origin worksheet and Mathematica by using the <b>Column</b> tab of the tool. This tab provides controls that allow you to specify the Mathematica variable and the Origin worksheet column for sending and receiving data, as well as the range of data to be exchanged. An Origin worksheet  column, or a specific range of rows in a worksheet column, will thus correspond to a user-defined variable in Mathematica.

<p>The <b>Mathematica Variable</b> text box should contain the name of the variable that will receive the worksheet data sent from Origin. The variable name is user-defined and should not start with a number. It should also not contain operators or periods. 
</p><p>The <b>Origin Dataset</b> text box should contain the name of the Origin dataset to be sent to Mathematica. Note that the new data range notation such as [Book1]Sheet1!Col(B) which allows addressing a specific column in a specific sheet in a specific book can be used to point to the desired worksheet column. This new range notation is recommended instead of the old dataset name notation such as Book1_B supported in previous versions. Note further that if you have an Origin worksheet active, you can refer to columns of the active worksheet by simply specifying only column information such as Col(1), Col(Pressure) etc.
</p><p>The <b>First Row</b> and <b>Last Row</b> text boxes can be used to specify a range of indices or rows for the Origin dataset column. The default values are 0 and if left unchanged, the entire dataset will be transferred.
</p><p>The <b>Send</b> button sends the data from the Origin worksheet column and assigns it to the Mathematica variable.

<h3><a name="The_Receive_Column_Group:"></a><span class="mw-headline">The Receive Column Group:</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Mathematica Variable</b> text box should contain the name of the Mathematica variable to be transferred to Origin. 
</p><p>The <b>Origin Dataset</b> text box should contain the name of the Origin worksheet column that will receive the  data from Mathematica. The column must exist in Origin and will not be created. 
</p><p>The <b>First Row</b> text box is used to specify the first row index of the Origin data column starting from which the inserted data will be placed. The default value is 0 which would insert the data from the first row.  
</p><p>The <b>Receive</b> button sends the data from the Mathematica variable and stores it in the Origin worksheet column.
