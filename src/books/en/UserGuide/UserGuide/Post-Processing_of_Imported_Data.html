<h1 class="firstHeading">6.4.4 Post-Processing of Imported Data</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>ImpWiz-PostProcess</p>
<p>There is a text box on the <b>Advanced Options</b> page of the Import Wizard that is used to specify LabTalk code to be executed after data import is complete.  This feature allows you to perform automatic post-processing of the imported data -- calculations, formatting, analysis, plotting, etc.  The LabTalk script can include X-Functions or Origin C functions, provided that Origin C functions have been compiled.  
</p><p>The <b>Advanced Options</b> page is added to the Import Wizard, when the <b>Save Filter</b> checkbox and the <b>Specify advanced filter options</b> (<a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Import_Wizard_Save_Filters_Page_(All_Data_Types).html" title="UserGuide:Import Wizard Save Filters Page (All Data Types)">Save Filters page</a>) boxes are both selected.  Note that the script is saved in the import filter.
