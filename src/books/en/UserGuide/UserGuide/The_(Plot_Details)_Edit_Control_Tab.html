<h1 class="firstHeading">9.3.7.15 The (Plot Details) Edit Control Tab</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>PD-Dialog-EditControl-Tab</p>
<p>The <b>Edit Control</b> tab appears at the Data level in Plot Details for 3D XYZ plots and controls the editing behavior of plot symbols and their projections.
For 3D XYZ Scatter plots, you can edit Line, Symbol, and Drop Line properties. You can additionally display projections onto the XY, YZ and ZX planes, each of which also has editable Line, Symbol, and Drop Line properties. This tab gives you options of editing all properties as a group, all properties independently or editing all projections as a group.
