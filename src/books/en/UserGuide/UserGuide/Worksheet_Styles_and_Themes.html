<h1 class="firstHeading">4.2.5 Applying Worksheet Styles and Saving Themes</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Wks-Styles-Themes</p>
<p>The worksheet style (or format) is a group of worksheet properties which can be copied to the Windows Clipboard.  The worksheet theme is simply a group of worksheet properties that have been saved to a file.  Once you save a set of worksheet properties as a Theme file (.OTH), you can reapply or modify them as needed.
</p><p>The <b>Copy and Paste Format</b> and the <b>Worksheet Theme</b> method which are the same as the customization methods of graph allow you to quickly customize the appearance of one or more worksheets, for instance, you might want to customize your worksheets when preparing documents for publishing in multiple formats.  You can use the <b>Copy and Paste Format</b> or the <b>Theme</b>  method to copy properties and apply them to one or more selected worksheets, to a current worksheet, to all worksheets in current book, to all worksheet in current folder, or to all worksheets in a project file.
</p><p>The following page will introduce the two methods above individually.
