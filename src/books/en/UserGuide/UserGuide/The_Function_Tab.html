<p>The <b>Function</b> tab allows you to create and plot Origin datasets using Mathematica functions.

<p><i>The Function Plot Group</i> 
</p><p>The <b>f(x)=</b> text box should be used to specify a function of the type F(x) recognizable to Mathematica. Note that Mathematica is case sensitive and so the function name should follow the exact Mathematica specification. The <b>From</b> and <b>To</b> text boxes should be used to specify the starting and ending x values for computing and plotting the function.  
</p><p>The <b>Points</b> radio button and associated text box allows you to specify the number of points that are calculated for the function. The <b>Increment</b> radio button and associated text box allows you to specify the spacing value between consecutive points that are calculated for the function.
</p><p><i>The Plot Button</i> 
</p><p>The <b>Plot</b> button sends the function to Mathematica, receives equally incremented X values (either the specified increment or the specified number of values), and receives the calculated Y values for each of these points. An Origin workbook is created that holds the X and Y values, and the data is plotted into an Origin graph window. Note that the workbook is created as a hidden object and can be viewed using the Project Explorer window in Origin.
</p><p>NOTE: If you wish to work with a user-defined function in Mathematica, you could use the following approach: Launch the Mathematica application directly and define and save your user-defined function a to disk file using the Mathematica Save[] command. Then you can load the function from disk to the kernel using the <a href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_Evaluate_Tab.html" title="UserGuide:The Evaluate Tab"><b>Evaluate</b> tab</a> described in the next section. Once the function has been loaded, it can then be used to plot an Origin graph using the <b>Function</b> tab.
