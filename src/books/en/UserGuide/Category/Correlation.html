<p>Correlation is a mathematical relationship between two random variables or signals.  In Statistics, correlation can be thought of as a normalized covariance.  A correlation of two identical signals is called an autocorrelation. 
</p><p>Correlation can be linear or circular. Generally speaking, linear correlation should be used when the input signals contain impulses, while circular correlation should be used when the signals repeat periodically.
</p><p>Strength of correlation is expressed by a correlation coefficient.  Let <i>f(n)</i> and <i>g(n)</i> be two signals of the same length, <i>M</i>. Their correlation coefficient can be defined as:
</p><p><img src="../images/Correlation/math-fce2f4841d98d191532131ea0211c28e.png?v=0" title="y(m)=\sum _{n=0}^{M-1}f(n)g(n-m)\,\!" alt="y(m)=\sum _{n=0}^{M-1}f(n)g(n-m)\,\!" class="tex"/>
</p><p>Note that if the input signals are not of the same length, the shorter one will be zero-padded to the length of the other signal. For linear correlation, the length of the result sequence is 2M-1, while the length of the result sequence for circular correlation is M.
</p><p>The magnitude of the computed correlation coefficient shows the degree of similarity between the signals.  If the magnitude is large, the two signals have a strong linear relationship.  Alternatively, if the magnitude is small, the two signals can be considered to have little or no linear relationship. 
</p><p>If the correlation coefficient is normalized (the <b>Normalize</b> checkbox is selected), its absolute value will range from 0 to 1, making it easier to judge the similarity between the signals.  If the normalized correlation coefficient is equal to either 1 or -1, the two signals are perfectly correlated.
</p><p>The sign of the correlation coefficient indicates the direction of association. A positive correlation suggests that the change of one signal will cause the other signal to change in the <b>same</b> direction; a positive linear relationship. If the correlation is negative, a negative linear relationship exists; an increase in one signal will cause a decrease in the other.
