<p>As with any ANOVA, repeated measures ANOVA is used for comparing three or more means .However, repeated measures ANOVA is used when all subjects  are measured  under a number of different conditions. As the subject is exposed to each condition in turn , the measurement of the dependent variable is repeated  .Using a standard ANOVA in this case result in inappropriate even incorrect conclusion ,because it fails to model the correlation between the repeated measures: the data violate the ANOVA assumption of independence. If any repeated factor is present, then repeated measures ANOVA should be used.
</p><p>In addition to determining that differences exist among the means, the repeated measurements ANOVA procedure provides multiple means comparisons that identify which particular means are different.
</p><p>Repeated measure ANOVA tools in Origin consider three possible designs:

<p>In the versions before Origin 2015, Repeated measures ANOVA in Origin requires that sample data are balanced, that is, equal size at each level.
