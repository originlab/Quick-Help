<h1 class="firstHeading">12.3 The X-Function Dialog Box</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Analysis-XF-Dialog</p>
<p>An X-Function can be rendered as an interactive dialog box, allowing you to specify information such as input and output data locations and values for various input parameters. The dialog box is automatically generated by Origin, based on information contained in the X-Function file. Thus, dialog boxes for all X-Functions have a uniform look and provide you with a set of common controls for specifying various parameters.  The following figure shows the <a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/Smooth.html">smooth X-Function</a> (category = Signal Processing) rendered as a dialog box.

<p>Display of an X-Function dialog box is controlled by a flag in the X-Function definition tree.  In situations where it is not necessary or not appropriate for the X-Function to display a dialog box, this flag can be turned off.  Please see the Programming Help files for further details.
