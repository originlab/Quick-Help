<li> We will use the sample project file in this tutorial. Right click the <b>Concave Hull</b> app icon <a  class="image"><img alt="Concave Hull icon.png" src="../images/Concave_Hull/Concave_Hull_icon.png?v=74593" width="32"  /></a> in the App Gallery and select <b>Show Samples in Folder</b>. In the folder that opens, drag -and-drop <i>example.opju</i> file into Origin workspace to open it.
<li> The contour in Graph1 is created from columns A-C in <i>[Book1]Sheet1</i>. We can see that there should be a hole in the contour, which is now filled with color as well. We will use <b>Concave Hull</b> app to create boundaries. With the contour active, click <b>Concave Hull</b> app icon <a  class="image"><img alt="Concave Hull icon.png" src="../images/Concave_Hull/Concave_Hull_icon.png?v=74593" width="32"  /></a> from App Gallery. The <b>Concave Hull</b> dialog will open.
<li> By default, if the active plot is created from XY datasets, it will be auto-picked as input. However, in this example, contour is created from XYZ datasets. So we will need to add it as <b>Input</b> manually.
<li> Enter 0.1 for <b>Alpha</b>. Note that you can check <b>Auto Preview</b> checkbox at the bottom to see the boundaries changes according to the alpha value.

<br />Click <b>OK</b> button.
<li> A red boundary line are added to the graph. And its XY coordinates appends to the source worksheet, <i>[Book1]Sheet1</i>.
<li> To use this boundary for contour, double click on the contour to open the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog. Active <b>Contouring Info</b> tab on the right panel. Check <b>Custom Boundary</b> check box and select the newly added column D and E for <b>Boundary X Data</b> and <b>Boundary Y Data</b> respectively.

<br />The final graph should look like following:
