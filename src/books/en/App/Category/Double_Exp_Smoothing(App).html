<p>Double exponential smoothing, also known as Holtâ€™s method, is an extension of single exponential smoothing and is used for smoothing time series data that exhibit trend. In addition to considering the weighted average of past observations, double exponential smoothing also takes into account the trend of the time series. This method is particularly useful for data with a consistent trend but no seasonality.
