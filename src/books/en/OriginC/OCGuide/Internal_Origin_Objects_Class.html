<tr>
<td> <a href="../../OriginC/Category/Collection_(class).html" title="Category:Collection (class)">Collection</a>
</td>
<td>
<p>This class provides a template for collections of various internal Origin objects, such as Pages (the collection of all PageBase objects in a project file), etc. This class contains an implicit templatized type _TemplType, which is the type of one element of the collection. For example, the templatized type of the Pages collection in the Project class (Collection&lt;PageBase&gt; Pages;) is PageBase.
</p><p>Each collection usually has a parent class, whose data member is the collection. For example, Collection&lt;PageBase&gt; Pages is one member of the Project class, because Project contains all the pages. Therefore, each collection can be attached or unattached to an internal object.
</p><p>All collections can use the methods defined in the Collection class. The foreach loop is the most useful way for looping once for each of the elements in the collection.

<p>This class is derived from the Layer and OriginObject classes, and it inherits their methods and properties. In this class, methods and properties are provided for Origin graph layers. 
</p><p>Internal Origin graph pages contain one or more graph layers, and graph layers contain one or more data plots. Thus, the GraphPage class contains a collection of GraphLayer objects, and the GraphLayer class contains a collection of DataPlot objects. A GraphLayer object is a wrapper object, which refers to an internal Origin graph layer object, but does not actually exist in Origin.

</p><p>Origin graph objects are generally contained in layers on an Origin page, thus the GraphLayer class contains a collection of GraphObjects. A Graph object is a wrapper object, which refers to an internal Origin graph object and does not exist in Origin. So multiple wrapper objects can refer to the same internal Origin object.

<td>
<p>This class is derived from the OriginObject class, from which it inherits methods and properties. In this class, methods and properties are provided for handling internal Origin layers. All Origin pages (windows), except note pages, contain one or more layers.  Origin objects found "on" a page are generally contained by layers which are themselves contained by the page. Many graph objects are contained in layers, thus the Layer class contains the collection of graph objects. 
</p><p>A Layer object is a wrapper object, which refers to an internal Origin layer object but does not actually exist in Origin. So multiple wrapper objects can refer to the same internal Origin object.

In this class, methods and properties are provided for handling matrix layers in Origin matrix pages. An Origin matrix contains a number of matrix objects, thus the MatrixLayer class contains a collection of the matrix objects in the matrix layer. 
</p><p>A MatrixLayer object is a wrapper object, which refers to an internal Origin matrix layer object, and does not actually exist in Origin. So multiple wrapper objects can refer to the same internal Origin object.

</td>
<td>
<p>This class is derived from the DataObject, DataObjectBase, and OriginObject classes, and it inherits their methods and properties. This class is used to handle internal Origin matrix objects.
</p><p>MatrixObject is mainly used to control the style of the data in the internal Origin matrix, while the Matrix class is used to access the data in the matrix. Thus, the MatrixObject class has the same relationship with the Matrix class as the Column class has with the Dataset class. That is to say, an internal Origin matrix object (MatrixObject) holds a matrix data set (Matrix), just like a worksheet column (Column) holds a data set (Dataset). The data values displayed in the cells of a matrix are considered Z values, whose associated X and Y values are linearly mapped to the columns and rows of the matrix, respectively. A MatrixLayer holds a collection of MatrixObjects, even though there is generally only one MatrixObject per MatrixLayer. 
</p><p>A MatrixObject is a wrapper object, which refers to an internal Origin matrix object yet does not actually exist in Origin . So multiple wrapper objects can refer to the same internal Origin object.

</td>
<td>
<p>This class provides methods and properties for internal Origin pages (windows). Usually, this class is used in one of two ways. One way is by using a PageBase object as a parameter of a general function, but not using a specific Page object. The other way is by attaching a PageBase object to an unknown active page. Both usages can handle the specific page objects polymorphically. That is also the purpose of this class: to act as an abstract class for its derived page types, which include Note, GraphPage, WorksheetPage, LayoutPage, and MatrixPage.
