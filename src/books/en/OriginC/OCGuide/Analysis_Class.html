<p>This class is the higher level Origin class. It wraps the NLFit class with a friendly interface to aid in implementing the fitting evaluation procedure. It is the kernel of the NLFit dialog. This class is recommended for coding in Origin C, because it takes care of all the complexities that arise from the process of interfacing to Origin.
