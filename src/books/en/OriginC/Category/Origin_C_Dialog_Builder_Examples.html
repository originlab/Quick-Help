<h1 class="firstHeading">4.1.1.4 Origin C Dialog Builder Examples</h1><p>Origin includes a number of sample dialogs each demonstrating how to programmatically access one or more controls in a Dialog Builder resource. This section describes how to use Origin and Code Builder to launch any of the Origin C Dialog Builder examples. It also describes how to use Microsoft Visual C++ to open and rebuild any of the example resource files used to construct the dialogs. The steps below use the Origin C Dialog Builder <span><b>TwoGraphs</b></span> example for demonstration purposes but all Origin Dialog Builder examples work in a similar manner. The remaining topics in this section describe and provide links to individual Dialog Builder sample dialogs.

<ol><li> If needed start Origin and open Code Builder by clicking the Code Builder toolbar button <a  class="image"><img alt="Origin C Dialog Builder Examples CodeBuilder.png" src="../images/Origin_C_Dialog_Builder_Examples/Origin_C_Dialog_Builder_Examples_CodeBuilder.png?v=38529" width="23"  /></a> on Origin's Standard toolbar.</li>
<li> Download <a class="external text" href="http://blog.originlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DialogBuilderExamples.zip" target="_blank">this zip file</a>, extract it.</li>
<li> Select the <span><b>File:Open</b></span> menu item in Code Builder. Browse to unzipped folder, and select any of the Origin C Dialog Builder example subfolders (e.g. \Dialog Builder\Graphs) and open the example source file of type *.C or *.CPP in Code Builder (e.g. TwoGraphs.c). Study the code as desired.</li>
<li> Add the source file (e.g. TwoGraphs.c) to the Code Builder workspace by activating it in the Code Builder Multiple Document Interface (MDI) and then pressing the CTRL+W keys. Select the <span><b>Tools:Rebuild All</b></span> menu item in Code Builder to compile and link all the files in the Origin C workspace.</li>
<li> Search in the example source file (e.g. TwoGraphs.c) for a function (e.g. <span><b>TwoGraphs</b></span>) containing code that declares an instance of a user-defined class object that encapsulates the example dialog (e.g. <span><b>CTwoDialog GraphDlg;</b></span>). The function should also include a statement that launches the example dialog using the Origin C Dialog class <span><b>DoModal</b></span> or <span><b>Create</b></span> member functions (e.g. <span><b>GraphDlg.DoModal( GetWindow());</b></span>).</li>
<li> Copy the name of the Origin C function containing the code described above to the clipboard (e.g. <span><b>TwoGraphs</b></span>).</li>
<li> Activate Origin. For the <span><b>TwoGraphs</b></span> example only, create and activate an Origin worksheet containing three columns of numeric data. Other example programs will include comments should they require additional setup in Origin.</li>
<li> Open the Script Window by selecting the Origin <span><b>Window:Script Window</b></span> menu item. Paste the name of the function (e.g. <span><b>TwoGraphs</b></span>) into the Script Window and press the Enter key. The function executes and launches the example dialog (e.g. Graph Controls) shown below.

<ol start="9">
<li> Close the example dialog (e.g. Graph Controls) in Origin, close Code Builder, and close Origin.</li>
<li> Start Microsoft Visual C++. Select the <span><b>File:Open Workspace</b></span> menu item and select Projects (*.dsp) from the Files of type drop down list in the Open Workspace dialog.</li>
<li> Browse to any of the Dialog Builder example subfolders in the unzipped folder at step 2 (e.g. <i>\Dialog Builder\Graphs\ResDLL</i>) and open an example workspace project file (e.g. Graphs.dsp).</li>
<li> Study (and customize) the Microsoft Visual C++ example project as desired and then select the Microsoft Visual C++ <span><b>Build:Rebuild All</b></span> menu item to rebuild the resource creating a new version of the DLL (e.g. \Samples\Dialog Builder\Graphs\Graphs.DLL).</li>
<li> Customize the accompanying Origin C source file to work with your resource changes. Rebuild the Code Builder workspace and run the example again.</li>
