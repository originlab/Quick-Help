<h1 class="firstHeading">4.1.1.1 Accessing Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C Classes</h1><p>To programmatically access Dialog Builder resources with Origin C you must first construct an Origin C object of type <span><b>Dialog</b></span> and then launch the dialog in your resource using the Origin C <span><b>Dialog</b></span> object (see the topic <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Launching_Dialog_Builder_Resources_with_Origin_C.html" title="DevKit:Launching Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C"> Launching Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C</a> for more detailed information). After the dialog is opened an Origin C object of the appropriate type is declared and attached to the desired control or resource. Once an Origin C object is successfully attached to the resource, the resource can be accessed by manipulating the methods and properties of the attached Origin C object (see the topic <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Accessing_Dialog_Builder_Resources_with_Origin_C.html" title="DevKit:Accessing Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C">Accessing Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C</a> for more information).
</p><p>For detailed information on the types of Dialog Builder resources accessible from Origin C see the <span><b>User Interface Controls</b></span> section in the <span><b>Classes</b></span> book of the <span><b>Origin C Language Reference</b></span>. Most of the classes in the <span><b>User Interface Controls</b></span> section of the <span><b>Origin C Language Reference</b></span> are Dialog Builder related. The methods of each Dialog Builder related class are listed with explanations and examples. For an additional source of information on the methods and properties of each Dialog Builder related class see the section <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Dialog_Builder_Related_Origin_C_Header_Files.html" title="DevKit:Dialog Builder Related Origin C Header Files">Dialog Builder Related Origin C Header Files</a>.
