<h1 class="firstHeading">4.1.3.14 Setting the TAB Order of Controls on a Dialog, Tab, or Page</h1><p>TAB order is the order in which focus moves between controls in a dialog (or tab or page) when you press the TAB key. To set the TAB order for the controls on your dialog (or tab or page), select the <span><b>Layout:Tab Order</b></span> menu item in Visual C++ and click on each control in the TAB order you desire. After you complete this process press the ENTER key. If you decide to change the TAB order of two or more controls, re-select the <span><b>Layout:Tab Order</b></span> menu item, press the CTRL key, and click on the control which is one TAB before the control that you want to change the TAB order for. For example, if you want to swap the TAB order for the controls that are currently in TAB position three and four, press CTRL and click on the control in TAB position two. Now click on the control for TAB position three and then four. Press ENTER to complete the process.
