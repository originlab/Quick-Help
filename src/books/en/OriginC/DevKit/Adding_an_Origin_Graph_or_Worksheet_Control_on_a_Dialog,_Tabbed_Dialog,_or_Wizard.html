<h1 class="firstHeading">4.1.3.2.1 Adding an Origin Graph or Worksheet Control on a Dialog, Tabbed Dialog, or Wizard</h1><p>You can display an Origin graph or worksheet on your resource so that the user can immediately see the result of their control selections in the resource. For example, the Origin Fitting Wizard displays an Origin graph containing raw fit data (gray scatter plot) and a fit curve (red line plot) generated as a result of operating various controls on its Fitting Control page and the Origin Import Wizard displays an Origin worksheet containing column designations (e.g. Time (X) (T&amp;N)) generated as a result of operating various controls on its Data Columns page.
