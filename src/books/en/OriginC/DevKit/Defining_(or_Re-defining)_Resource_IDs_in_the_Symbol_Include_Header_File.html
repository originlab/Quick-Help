<h1 class="firstHeading">4.1.3.2.4 Defining (or Re-defining) Resource IDs in the Symbol Include Header File</h1><p>When you <a href="../../OriginC/Category/Creating_A_Microsoft_Visual_C_Plus_Plus_Resource-only_DLL.html" title="Category:Creating A Microsoft Visual C Plus Plus Resource-only DLL"> create a resource using the Origin Dialog AppWizard</a> the resource ID strings for the dialog, tabbed dialog, wizard, tab and wizard placeholders, and tabs and wizard pages are automatically defined. Similarly, when you <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Adding_Controls_on_a_Dialog,_Tabbed_Dialog,_or_Wizard.html" title="DevKit:Adding Controls on a Dialog, Tabbed Dialog, or Wizard"> add a control to a resource</a> its resource ID string is automatically defined by Visual C++. Generally, you will <span><i>not</i></span> need to (and we recommend that you <span><i>not</i></span>) manually define resource ID strings. However, there may be occasions when you have to or want to define new or re-define existing resource ID strings (see <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Adding_Tabs_or_Wizard_Pages_after_the_Origin_Dialog_AppWizard_is_Closed.html" title="DevKit:Adding Tabs or Wizard Pages after the Origin Dialog AppWizard is Closed">Adding Tabs or Wizard Pages After the Origin Dialog AppWizard is Closed</a> for one such case).
</p><p>To define a new or re-define an existing resource ID string follow the steps below.
</p>
<ol><li> Open the Symbol include header file for your Visual C++ project (See the section <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Renaming_the_Symbol_Include_Header_File.html" title="DevKit:Renaming the Symbol Include Header File">Renaming the Symbol Include Header File</a> to determine the name of your Symbol include header file and see the section <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Opening_your_Resource_and_Workspace_Files.html" title="DevKit:Opening your Resource and Workspace Files">Opening your Resource and Workspace Files</a> to learn how to open header files in Visual C++). If you created your Visual C++ project with the Origin Dialog AppWizard and closely followed the recommended steps this file should be named <span><b>&lt;Your Project Name&gt;Res.h</b></span> where <span><b>&lt;Your Project Name&gt;</b></span> is the name of your Visual C++ project. The images below show typical Symbol include header files for a tabbed dialog and a  wizard.<a  class="image"><img alt="Defining (or Re-defining) Resource IDs in the Symbol Include Header File image119.gif" src="../images/Defining_(or_Re-defining)_Resource_IDs_in_the_Symbol_Include_Header_File/Defining__28or_Re-defining_29_Resource_IDs_in_the_Symbol_Include_Header_File_image119.gif?v=0" width="455"  /></a><a  class="image"><img alt="Defining (or Re-defining) Resource IDs in the Symbol Include Header File image118.gif" src="../images/Defining_(or_Re-defining)_Resource_IDs_in_the_Symbol_Include_Header_File/Defining__28or_Re-defining_29_Resource_IDs_in_the_Symbol_Include_Header_File_image118.gif?v=0" width="452"  /></a></li>
<li> To define a new resource ID string click at the end of the line on an existing #define directive and press ENTER. In the new line, type a new #define directive using the syntax<br /><pre>#define IDD_STRING VALUE</pre><br />for a dialog, tabbed dialog, wizard, tab, or wizard page and using the syntax<br /><pre>#define IDC_STRING VALUE</pre>for all other resource types. In the syntax definitions above replace STRING with a unique and descriptive string ID for the resource and replace VALUE with a unique <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Required_Numeric_ID_Ranges_for_Various_Resource_Types.html" title="DevKit:Required Numeric ID Ranges for Various Resource Types">numeric ID that is in the required range for the given resource type</a>.<br /><span>For example, to add a resource ID string for a new wizard page in the Symbol include header file for the wizard shown above click at the end of the line for the</span><br /><pre>#define IDD_SECONDPAGE 3001</pre><br />directive and press ENTER. Then, in the new line, <span>type the following text:</span><br /><pre>#define IDD_THIRDPAGE 3002</pre></li>
<li> To re-define an existing resource ID string simply edit the resource ID string and numeric ID in the Symbol include header file making sure that the new definition follows the correct syntax, that the string and numeric IDs are unique, and that the numeric ID falls within the required numeric ID range for the given resource type. See step 2 above for the correct syntax and a link to a table listing required numeric ID ranges.</li>
<li> After you finish editing the Symbol include header file, click the <span><b>Save</b></span> button on the <span><b>Standard toolbar</b></span> to save your changes and then select the <span><b>File:Close</b></span> menu item to close the header file in the development area.</li>
<li> Finally, if you re-define the STRING portion of an existing resource ID string already assigned to a resource in your dialog make sure you update the resource ID string in the <span><b>ID</b></span> combo box of your resource's <span><b>Properties</b></span> dialog. See <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Setting_the_Properties_of_Controls_in_your_Resource.html" title="DevKit:Setting the Properties of Controls in your Resource">Setting the Properties of Controls in your Resource</a> for more information.</li></ol>
