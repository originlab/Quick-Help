<h1 class="firstHeading">4.1.3.15 Specifying Tab (Page) Captions, IDs, and Names</h1><p>If you are creating a tabbed dialog (or a wizard) the fourth page of the Origin Dialog AppWizard will allow you to add however many tabs (or pages) your dialog will contain. The AppWizard automatically adds two tabs (or pages) to your dialog because presumably you will want at least two tabs (pages) otherwise you would probably have created a simple dialog project. The AppWizard also allows you to add additional tabs (pages) by entering the information below and then clicking the   <b>Add</b> button.
</p>
<p align="center"><a  class="image"><img alt="Specifying Tab (Page) Captions, IDs, and Names image137.gif" src="../images/Specifying_Tab_(Page)_Captions,_IDs,_and_Names/Specifying_Tab__28Page_29_Captions_2C_IDs_2C_and_Names_image137.gif?v=0" width="477"  /></a></p>
<ol><li> Enter the desired caption for the new tab (page) in the <span><b>Caption</b></span> text box. The caption displays as the title of the tab (page).</li>
<li> Enter a resource ID string for the new tab (page) in the <span><b>Resource ID</b></span> text box. The resource ID string will be added to the Symbol header file as a #define directive. The Origin Dialog AppWizard will automatically set the correct numeric ID value in the #define directive. You need only specify the resource ID string. For a tab (page), use the notation: IDD_STRING where IDD_ is literal and STRING can be any letters or numbers. You can type the characters in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case. The AppWizard and Visual C++ will maintain the case of the characters that you enter.</li>
<li> Enter the desired Origin C name for the new tab (page) in the <span><b>Origin C Name</b></span> text box. The text that you enter in the Origin C Name text box is the name you will use to communicate with the tab (page) inside your Origin C program in Origin. The Origin Dialog AppWizard will automatically define an Origin C Dialog derived class for each tab (page) based on the text that you enter for it in the Resource ID and Origin C Name text boxes. This name can not contain spaces. It is also case-sensitive.</li></ol>
<p><br />
In addition to adding tabs (pages) the fourth page of the AppWizard allows you to change the order of existing tabs (pages) by selecting them in the list and then clicking the <span><b>Up</b></span> or <span><b>Down</b></span> buttons. Tabs (pages) can also be deleted by selecting them in the list and clicking the <span><b>Remove</b></span><span> button. Once a tab (page) is added it can not be edited. Tabs (pages) can only be edited by removing and then re-adding them as desired.</span>
</p><p>After entering the above tab (page) related information click the <span><b>Finish</b></span> button to close the AppWizard and open the New Project Information dialog. Peruse the information in the New Project Information dialog and then click OK to create you dialog resource and Visual C++ project.
