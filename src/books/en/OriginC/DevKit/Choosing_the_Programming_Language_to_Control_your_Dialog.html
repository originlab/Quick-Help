<h1 class="firstHeading">4.1.3.4 Choosing the Programming Language to Control your Dialog</h1><p>The second page in the Origin Dialog AppWizard allows you to select the programming language you want to use to control your dialog.

<p align="center"><a  class="image"><img alt="Choosing the Programming Language to Control Your Dialog DMWiz2of3.png" src="../images/Choosing_the_Programming_Language_to_Control_your_Dialog/Choosing_the_Programming_Language_to_Control_Your_Dialog_DMWiz2of3.png?v=38590" width="477"  /></a></p>
<p>It is strongly recommended that you select <span><b>Origin C</b></span> to control your dialog. Using Origin C greatly simplifies creating the resource (a Visual C++ string table is not required when using Origin C) and simplifies the coding required to control the resource. It is also recommended that you select the <span><b>Use Classes</b></span> check box. Among other advantages, using classes encapsulates the functionality of your dialog within a class object allowing you to hide implementation details. Using classes also allows you to declare controls on your dialog once as class members (which are always available inside the scope of your class) rather than having to declare them in each function. When selected these two options cause the Origin Dialog AppWizard to create a header file containing class based template code that can be used to control the dialog (object declarations, message maps, event handler functions, etc.). <span><b>LabTalk</b></span> can still be used to control a Dialog Builder dialog but it is recommended that you not use <span><b>LabTalk</b></span>. It is included primarily for backwards compatibility.
</p><p>After selecting a programming language click the <span><b>Next</b></span> button at the bottom of the Origin Dialog AppWizard. You will then be prompted for the dialog caption, ID, and name.
