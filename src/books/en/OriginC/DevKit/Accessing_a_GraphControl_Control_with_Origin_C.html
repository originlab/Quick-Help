<h1 class="firstHeading">4.1.1.4.2 Accessing a GraphControl Control with Origin C</h1><p>The <span><b>Graphs</b></span> example demonstrates how to access graph controls in a Dialog Builder resource. To access the graph controls in the Graph Controls dialog below the example program uses the Origin C <span><b>GraphControl</b></span> class. The example dialog is launched by executing the function <span><b>TwoGraphs</b></span> in the source file TwoGraphs.c found in <a class="external text" href="http://blog.originlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DialogBuilderExamples.zip" target="_blank">this zip file</a>, under the <i>\Dialog Builder\Graphs</i> subfolder of Origin.
