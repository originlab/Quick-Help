</p>
<ul><li> The Origin upgrade installs into a new program folder - it does not update a previous version. It is therefore not necessary to install or uninstall a previous version of Origin before upgrading. </li>
<li> If you are upgrading from Origin 2018 or a later version, the process should be pretty painless. Origin 2018 and later versions share a common license file and User Files Folder. The first time you run Origin, it should be licensed and know where your User Files are located.</li>
<li> If you are upgrading from Origin 2017, you will be prompted to pick a new User Files Folder (see <b>Selecting a User Files Folder</b>, <a href="../../GettingStarted/OriginLab/Origin_Installation_and_Startup.html#Selecting_a_User_Files_Folder" title="OriginLab:Origin Installation and Startup">below</a>). If you have custom Origin files from your previous version, you can transfer them to your new <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_User_Files_Folder.html"><b>User Files Folder</b></a>. From the <b>Preferences</b> menu, select <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Transfer_User_Files.html"><b>Transfer User Files</b></a>.   Provided your Maintenance has not expired, you should not have to re-license your software. If your Maintenance has expired, you will need to re-license your Origin software (See <a href="../../GettingStarted/OriginLab/Origin_Installation_and_Startup.html#Registering_Origin" title="OriginLab:Origin Installation and Startup"><b>Registering Origin</b></a>, below).</li>
<li> If you are upgrading from Origin 2016 or earlier, you will need to complete the license management process. When your upgrade is launched for the first time, a license dialog will display asking for your <b>Product Key</b> If you have custom Origin files from your previous version, you can transfer them to your new <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_User_Files_Folder.html"><b>User Files Folder</b></a>. From the <b>Preferences</b> menu, select <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Transfer_User_Files.html"><b>Transfer User Files</b></a>.  </li>
<li>  If you have a dongle package, please update your dongle after the Maintenance renewal to make sure your dongle is available for the latest version. Upgrade your dongle by entering a <b>Product Key</b> in the <b>License Activation</b> dialog. Once done, you can use this dongle for Origin installed with the same serial number on any other computers without re-activating the dongle.</li></ul>
<p><br />
Lastly, we want to point out that your Origin software has some great new features. For more information on key features by version, see the <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/VersionComparison" target="_blank"><b>originlab.com/VersionComparison</b></a> page on our website.

</p><p>In addition to the InstallShield setup that runs from the Product DVD, an MSI installer and sample transform are available. The MSI installer is ideal for use at multi-user sites, as it can be used to build an Origin installation package for distribution.

<h2><a name="Installing_Origin"></a><span class="mw-headline">Installing Origin</span></h2>
<p>Origin is a Windows application. You can run Origin on an Intel-based Mac from <b>Boot Camp</b> or by running a virtualization software. For more information, see the <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Support/DocumentationAndHelpCenter/Installation/RunOriginonaMac" target="_blank"><b>Running Origin on Mac using Virtualization Software</b></a>, on the OriginLab website.
</p><p>There are three steps that must be completed to prepare Origin for use:
</p>
<ul><li> Installation</li>
<li><a href="#Selecting_a_User_Files_Folder">Selecting a User Files Folder</a></li>
<li><a href="#Licensing_Origin">License management</a></li></ul>
<p>Both the Origin upgrade and the newly-purchased products install into a new program folder. Origin does not overwrite previous versions when upgrading, so your old version continues to function. Likewise, your original version does not have to be installed when running the upgrade.
</p><p>If you are installing from a DVD, the startup program that launches when you insert the Origin DVD, includes an Origin installation button. If the startup program does not automatically run, you can browse the DVD to <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Support/DocumentationAndHelpCenter/Installation/DirectInstall" target="_blank">launch the setup.exe</a>.

<p>If you already have the trial version of Origin installed on your computer, you can convert it to the full product or upgrade.
</p>
<ul><li> If you have purchased the Origin package with node-locked license management, run Origin and select <b>Help:Convert Trial to Product</b>; or you can use <b>Help: Activate License</b>, click the “Or if you have purchased already” radio button and choose <b>Activate for this computer</b>. In either case, you will be asked to enter the <a class="external text" href="../../License/Category/Single-User_Node-Locked_License(License).html#Get_Product_Key"><b>Product Key</b></a> that was generated when you registered your software purchase on originlab.com.</li>
<li> For all other license management packages, run the Origin <b>Add or Remove Files</b> program located in the Origin program icon folder, or rerun the Origin installer (both require a log in account with administrator permissions). When the Origin setup program starts, select the <b>Modify</b> option and then select <b>Install Product</b> (requires serial number).</li></ul>
<h3><a name="How_to_Correct_or_Change_your_Serial_Number_After_you_Complete_an_Installation"></a><span class="mw-headline">How to Correct or Change your Serial Number After you Complete an Installation</span></h3>
<p>If you installed Origin with an incorrect serial number, you can correct it by running the Origin <b>Add or Remove Files</b> program located in your Origin program icon folder, or rerun the Origin installer (both require a log in account with administrator permissions). When the Origin setup program starts, select the <b>Modify</b> option and then click <b>Yes</b> to change your serial number.
</p>
<h2><a name="Selecting_a_User_Files_Folder"></a><span class="mw-headline">Selecting a User Files Folder</span></h2>
<p><span class="OIndex" style="display:none">User Files Folder (UFF)</span>
Each Windows login user must maintain a <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_User_Files_Folder.html">User Files Folder (UFF)</a> for storing Origin user data:
</p>
<ul><li> If you are upgrading from Origin 2018 or later versions, your User Files Folder (UFF) location is unchanged.</li>
<li> If you are upgrading from Origin 2017 or earlier, you will be prompted to pick a location for a new UFF. You must choose a different path from your old UFF. </li>
<li> To transfer the contents of your old UFF and your toolbar and workspace configurations to the new UFF, you can run the Origin software and selecting <b>Preferences</b>: <b><span class="OIndex">Transfer User Files</span></b>. For more information, see <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Transfer_User_Files.html">Transfer User Files</a>.</li></ul>
<p><br />
<i><b>Consider these points in selecting your UFF:</b></i>
</p>
<ul><li> If you have a mobile computer, it is best to select a location on your computer rather than on your network.</li>
<li> For non-mobile computers, you can select a location on the computer or on the network, as long as you have stable access to the folder. <span class="OIndex" style="display:none">Networks, Installation</span> </li>
<li> Do not select the same UFF as other Origin users. To learn how to share custom files with other Origin users, please see the chapter on <a href="../../GettingStarted/OriginLab/Sharing_Origin_Files.html" title="OriginLab:Sharing Origin Files">Sharing Origin Files</a>, later in this Guide.</li></ul>
<p>Each time Origin starts, the program checks to see that your UFF is accessible. If Origin cannot connect to the UFF, you will be prompted to select a new location for the UFF. Note that you can change the location of your UFF at any time while running Origin. From the <b>Preferences</b> menu, select <b>Options</b> and then click the <b>System Path</b> tab.
</p>
<h2><a name="Licensing_Origin"></a><span class="mw-headline">Licensing Origin</span></h2>
<p>All Origin packages include license management. The type of license management provided with your package is determined at the time of your Origin purchase.
</p>
<h3><a name="Node-locked"></a><span class="mw-headline">Node-locked</span></h3>
<p><span class="OIndex" style="display:none">License, Node-locked</span>
Each Origin computer requires a license to run Origin. The license is obtained from the OriginLab website by entering a <b>Product Key</b> in the <b>License Activation</b> dialog when you start Origin. In-dialog instructions are provided for computers with no internet access.

Your IT department or Origin administrator installs a FLEXnet license server provided by OriginLab (available from the Origin DVD), obtains a license for this server from the OriginLab website, and then sets up a license service. The license service counts and restricts the number of Origin computers that can run concurrently.
For more information, see the Help Center on the OriginLab website (<a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Support/DocumentationAndHelpCenter" target="_blank"><b>originlab.com/HelpCenter</b></a>).

<h2><a name="Registering_Origin"></a><span class="mw-headline">Registering Origin</span></h2>
<p><span class="OIndex" style="display:none">Origin, Registering</span>
Registering Origin is required to obtain product support from OriginLab and the team of Origin distributors.  Registration also activates Origin's <b>Check for Updates</b> menu command (<b>Help: Check for Updates</b>), allowing you to obtain patch and help file updates directly from your Origin software. In addition, Origin's <b>App Center</b> and <b>Template Center</b> dialog, which provide direct access to Apps&amp;Templates and their updates from your Origin software, requires that your installation be registered.
</p><p>For <b>Node-locked</b> licenses, registration is completed automatically when you enter a <b>Product Key</b> into the License Activation dialog box that opens when you start Origin.  To verify that you are registered, select <b>About Origin</b> from the <b>Help</b> menu.  The dialog should display the <b>Registration ID</b> that is assigned to your Origin installation.
