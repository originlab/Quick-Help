<h1 class="firstHeading"> Automation Server</h1><p class='hierarchy' style='display: none'>COM</p>
<p><br />
</p><p>Component Object Model (COM) is a Microsoft centric interface standard for software componentry. It is used to enable interprocess communication and dynamic object creation in programming languages that support COM. The term COM is often used in the software development industry as an umbrella term that encompasses OLE, OLE Automation, ActiveX, COM+ and DCOM.
</p><p>Origin can function as an automation server whereby other applications communicate with Origin using methods and properties exposed by Origin.  Any application that supports COM programming, such as Visual Basic, Microsoft Excel, National Instruments LabVIEW, etc., can function as the client application that connects with Origin.  Such applications can exchange data back and forth with Origin and can send commands to be executed by Origin.
</p><p>A typical client application may involve some, or many, of the following steps:
</p>
<ol><li> Launching the Origin application.</li>
<li> Opening a previously customized Origin project file or preparing the default project to receive data from the client.</li>
<li> Sending data (collected from hardware) to Origin.</li>
<li> Sending commands to Origin to process the data or have Origin update result columns using the automatic column update feature.</li>
<li> Getting results back from Origin in the form of worksheet or matrix data.</li>
<li> Getting images of graphs and layout pages back from Origin.</li>
<li> Saving the Origin project.</li>
<li> Closing the Origin application.</li></ol>
<p>Once the client closes the connection users can launch Origin at a later time and re-open the project saved by the client for further processing.
