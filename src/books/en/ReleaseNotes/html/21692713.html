Suppose that the scientist is researching pollution in the Baltic Sea, and they would like to use the spectra of samples of sea water to determine the amounts of three compounds present in samples from the Baltic Sea: lignin sulfonate (pulp industry pollution), humic acids (natural forest products), and detergent (optical whitener).<br /> <br />The scientist also has data of the spectra emission intensities at different frequencies in sample spectrum (v1-v27)</p><p>The three compounds of interest are: lignin sulfonate (ls), which is pulp industry pollution; humic acid (ha), a natural forest product; and an optical whitener from detergent (dt).</p><p>Partial least square regression can help to establish a model to predict the amounts of three compounds from v1-v27</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>To Perform the Analysis</strong></p><ol><li>Activate <strong>Sheet1</strong> in <strong>Book1</strong>.

The VIP score is a measure of a variable’s importance in modeling both X and Y. If a variable has a small coefficient and a small VIP, then it is a candidate for deletion from the model (Wold,1995). A value of 0.8 is generally considered to be a small VIP (Eriksson et al, 2006) and a red line is drawn on the plot at 0.8.</p><p>5&gt; Columns in the PLSResults1 sheet are coefficients values of the X variables for each Y predictor.</p><p style="margin-left: 30.0px;"><strong><br /></strong></p>
