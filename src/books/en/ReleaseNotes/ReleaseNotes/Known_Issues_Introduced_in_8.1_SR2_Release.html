<h1 class="firstHeading">Known Issues Introduced in 8.1 SR2 Release</h1><p><br />
</p>
<ol><li> Before SR2, in a graph with grouped plot, user can single click once to select the whole group. Single click again one of them to select that plot only. In sr2, we added a system variable @dd to add a delay in doing so. ID = 15181. 
<ul><li> The default is @dd=200. So there is 200 mini seconds delay. So you need to hold the mouse over 200 msec to second single plot. If you set @dd=0, it will be back to pre-sr2 behavior. </li>
<li> This is because if you select a plot and double click - special point is added and set active in the plot details dialog, which is confusing. Delay allows distinguishing between user intentions - drilling down or double clicking. Drill down modifies selection while double click should not.</li>
<li> We wil change it back to be like sr1 in sr3.</li></ul></li>
<li>Easy to crash Origin when modifying special points on a <font color="red">SELECTED</font> plot in Plot Details. ID=15181.
<ul><li> Plot any 2D graphs.</li>
<li> Single click on the plot to make it selected.</li>
<li> Press CTRL key and double click on one point to open Plot Details dialog.</li>
<li> Make any modification for that specail point and close dialog, then Origin will crash.</li>
<li> If no step2 (select the plot), crash can be avoided.</li></ul></li>
<li> Fail to use <font color="red">shift</font> key to select multiple plots. ID=15200</li>
<li> Parameter Initialization values for "ExpDec1" function became weird for many normal Exponential Decay 1 type data. ID=14828</li>
<li> Project files saved with Rise-Time Gadget can not open in O80 versions. (O80 will crash.) Generally, any GROBJ_TN_MARKER type Graph Object can not use in O80 versions. ORG-3091</li></ol>
