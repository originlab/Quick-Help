<td>Script After Fitting did not work in SR0.
</td>
<td>Script After Fitting allows the user to define a script to run after a fit is completed.  This feature failed in SR0 for built-in and user-defined functions when defined on either the Code tab of the Nonlinear Curve Fit (NLFit) dialog, or in a Fitting Function (FDF) file.  Script After Fitting has been fixed in SR1.

<td>If a user-defined fitting function (FDF file) was not in the same category as specified in the .opj, Change Parameter did not work.
</td>
<td> This occurred when users shared .opj and FDF file on different Origin installations.  (Typical scenario:  User A creates a user-defined FDF under a specific category and an .opj with a fitting using that function, then shares these files with User B.  User B does not place the FDF file into the same category as User A, and tries to Change Parameters. This fails because Origin can not find the FDF file.)  This has been fixed in SR1 so that Origin automatically locates the FDF file.

Most cells in the intermediate table are links to a hierarchy result sheet.  Users may copy cells from this intermediate table, paste them into another worksheet, and perform further calculations (e.g., Set Column Value) with this linked data.

(To reproduce in SR0:  Right-click on an axis with customized break settings, select Copy Format: All. Then right-click another axis, or an axis in another graph, and click Paste Format.

(To reproduce in SR0, import the sample data file Gaussian.dat.  Select column B and plot it as a line graph.  In Origin’s main menu, click Gadgets, then Quick Fit, and then Peak–Gauss.  Right-click the layer and select Copy.  Click the right-triangle button.  Observe this error in the Script Window:  TreeNode does not exist, access denied.)  This has been fixed in SR1 so that clicking the right-triangle button brings up a context menu.

In Origin's main menu, click Gadgets, and then click Quick Peaks.  Click OK to accept the default settings.  Now delete the layer with the ROI.  Click Undo to bring the layer back.  Move the ROI around and observe that the "peak(s) found" label has become disassociated with the ROI.)  This has been fixed in SR1 so that the label remains associated with the ROI.

Even with small files, this behavior was often problematic, especially if Excel had been installed on the system but not yet used.

Each time the user opened certain dialogs (Export Graphs, for example), the dialog box shifted further to the left, eventually moving off the screen.
