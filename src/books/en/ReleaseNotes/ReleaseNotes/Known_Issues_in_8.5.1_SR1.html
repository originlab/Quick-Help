<td>Dynamic merging does not work on the Units row.
</td>
<td>Identical column labels and data can be dynamically merged horizontally or vertically by setting <b>Dynamic Merge</b> on the Format tab of the <b>Worksheet Properties</b> dialog. However, the Dynamic Merge control for Units is not working. <br />The workaround is:

<li>In the Script Window, type <b>@wef=1</b> and press <b>Enter</b>. This will add <b>Edit Formatting...</b> context menu in worksheet.<br /></li>
<li>Right-click in the gray area in the workbook. In the context menu, click <b>Edit Formatting...</b><br /></li>
<li>In the Worksheet Theme Editor, expand the <b>Root</b> folder, the <b>Name Styles</b> folder, the <b>ogUnit</b> folder, and the <b>Style</b> folder.  In the <b>Merge</b> row, click <b>None</b> and select <b>Horizontal</b> from the dropdown menu. <br /></li>
<li>Click <b>Apply</b> and then close the dialog box. <br /></li>
<li>If you want workbook units to ALWAYS be merged:  From Origin's main menu, click <b>Worksheet</b>, then click <b>Clear Worksheet...</b>  Click <b>OK</b> to confirm.    Then, from the File menu, click <b>Save Template As...</b> to save this as your default Origin.otw template<br /></li>
