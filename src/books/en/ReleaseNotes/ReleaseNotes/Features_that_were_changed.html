<p><a href="#Index">top</a>
</p>
<h3><a name="Active_Dataset_vs._Selected_Dataset"></a><span class="mw-headline">Active Dataset vs. Selected Dataset</span></h3>
<p>When performing analysis from a graph, the <b>Input Data</b> node in the analysis dialog will be assigned to the active dataset, as indicated in the legend by the "red rectangle". In the case of a grouped plot (multiple datasets), if the analysis supports more than one Range, the <b>Input Data</b> node will be assigned to all data plots. 
</p><p>You can override this, by clicking in your graph to select your plotted curve. In this case, your selection will be recognized and assigned as the <b>Input Data</b>. When clicking a grouped data plot, all curves get selected. Click again to select just that one.
</p>
<h3><a name="Analysis_Automation_-_AutoUpdate_is_now_Recalculation"></a><span class="mw-headline">Analysis Automation - AutoUpdate is now Recalculation</span></h3>
<p>Previous to Origin 8, we offered one situation where 'analysis' was automated&#160;: in Set Column Values. When you entered an expression in Set Column Values, you were given the option of AutoUpdate. When you chose AutoUpdate, a Lock icon appeared in the column header after execution
and if any data in the Set Column Values expression changed, the Lock would briefly turn yellow to indicate an Update was needed, the expression would evaluate and the column would update. The
lock is an indication that a column is the result of an expression and that the column is Read Only.
</p><p>This concept has been extended in Origin 8 to include many Analysis operations including Statistics and Fitting. The AutoUpdate has been changed to Recalculate and now has three modes&#160;:
</p>
<ul><li> None - No Auto Update will occur.</li>
<li> Manual - Auto Update is deferred. Lock icons associated with any pending operation will display as Yellow until the Update is requested.</li>
<li> Auto - Any time dependent data of an operation changes, the operation will execute again and all results will update.</li></ul>
<p>A new tool on the Standard Toolbar - Recalculate - indicates if any Manual recalculations are pending (the tool turns yellow in such cases) and its Tool Tip indicates how many operations are pending. There is also an AutoUpdate tool (not displayed by default - see View&#160;: Toolbars&#160;: [Button Groups]&#160;: Auto Update) that can be used to globally shut off Auto Update. When Auto Update is turned back on with this tool, any Auto Update operations that were blocked by the tool will then execute.
</p><p>Left-clicking a Lock icon now opens a context menu for various options related to an operation.
</p>
<h3><a name="Analysis_Theme.2FTemplate"></a><span class="mw-headline">Analysis Theme/Template</span></h3>
<p>From Origin 8, the theme and template concept have expanded from graphing to analysis features. You can save the settings in analysis dialogs as themes and access these themes from menu or dialog drop-down. To know how to save and use the analysis theme, please refer to <a class="external text" href="../../Tutorial/Tutorial/Analysis_Themes.html">this example</a>. For complicated analysis procedures, you can further save the procedures as an template and reuse the template by just importing new datasets. To see how analysis template works, please open the <i>Dose Response Analysis.ogw</i> in the \<i>Samples</i>\<i>Curve Fitting</i> folder.
</p>
<h3><a name="Interactive_Data_Selector_Available_for_Chosing_Input_and_Output_Ranges"></a><span class="mw-headline">Interactive Data Selector Available for Chosing Input and Output Ranges</span></h3>
<p>To the right of an input/output data range, there is usually a Interactive Data Selector
control <a  class="image"><img alt="Interactive Range Selection Control.png" src="../images/Features_that_were_changed/Interactive_Range_Selection_Control.png" width="18"  /></a> and a triangle button. When the Interactive Data Selector button is clicked, you will be allowed to make a workbook/graph active and select the data range for input/output.  The triangle button, on the other hand, provides a short-cut to reseting or reselecting the data.

<h4><a name="Well_Organized_Input_Data"></a><span class="mw-headline">Well Organized Input Data</span></h4>
<p>Origin 8 automatically recognizes all datasets in the active layer. When bringing up the NLFit dialog, all data ranges in the layer will be imported into the <b>InputData</b> node.
</p><p>Settings related to input curve are under each input data range branch. For example, when fitting multiple dataset you can use a global weighting method or specify a particular weighting method for each curve under the <b>y</b> branch.

<h3><a name="Changes_in_Design"></a><span class="mw-headline">Changes in Design</span></h3>
<h4><a name="Separate_function_definition_and_curve_fitting_dialogs"></a><span class="mw-headline">Separate function definition and curve fitting dialogs</span></h4>
<p>In Origin 8, the <b>Fitting Function Organizer</b> (<b>Tools: Fitting Function Organizer</b>) organizes all fitting functions. From this dialog, you can add or remove fitting functions as well as simulate a curve.
</p>
<h4><a name="Remove_Before_.2F_After_Fit_Script"></a><span class="mw-headline">Remove Before / After Fit Script</span></h4>
<p>The Before/After Fit Script feature has been removed from the GUI. In previous versions of Origin, you could enter LabTalk scripts, to be run either before or after fitting, directly into the NLSF dialog box. Beginning with Origin 8, we recommend using an X-Function for pre-processing of data and the use of auto update for column values, if needed (Recalculate = Auto).  If you wish to make use of the older methods, you must edit the [INITIALIZATIONS] and [AFTER FITTING] sections of the FDF directly, using a text editor.
</p>
<h4><a name="Derived_Parameters"></a><span class="mw-headline">Derived Parameters</span></h4>
<p>Origin 8 allows you to specify <b>Derived Parameters</b> to be calculated.  Input them in the editbox in the Function Organizer dialog and then Save the function. Once you have defined derived parameters (for example in the DoseResp fitting function), Origin will calculate these parameter values and output them in fit reports.

<h3><a name="Changes_in_Settings"></a><span class="mw-headline">Changes in Settings</span></h3>
<p>On the <b>Settings&#160;: Fitted Curves</b> page, when the <b>X Data Type</b> is <b>Uniform Linear</b>, the number of Points has been increased from 60 to 100. In Origin 7.5, the fit curve displayed on the graph is generated with y values computed only at the x values of the dataset.  From a fitting point of view, this makes no difference, but to the user fitting few points, the fit curve may not look good or as smooth while iterating.  In Origin 8, the fit curve displayed in the dialog preview uses the <b>X Data Type</b> setting, so if set to the default of <b>Uniform Linear</b> the fit curve will be drawn with 100 points.  ID = 3757
</p>
<h3><a name="Fitted_Parameters_on_Graphs"></a><span class="mw-headline">Fitted Parameters on Graphs</span></h3>
<p>When the fitting is performed on plotted data, the result can be pasted back to the graph.  In Origin 7.5, the result is pasted into a text label.  However, in Origin 8, the result is put into a table.  And you can customized which template used to create such table in the NLFit dialog.

<h3><a name="Find_and_Replace_Implemented_for_Worksheet_and_Matrix"></a><span class="mw-headline">Find and Replace Implemented for Worksheet and Matrix</span></h3>
<p>In Origin 8, you can Find and Replace both Worksheet and Matrix cell values from the <b>Edit: Find</b> and <b>Edit: Replace</b> menus. For more find/replace settings, you can also use the <b>wreplace</b> and <b>mreplace</b> X-Functions.
</p>
<h3><a name="Improved_Extract_Worksheet_Data"></a><span class="mw-headline">Improved Extract Worksheet Data</span></h3>
<p>The new <b>Extract Worksheet Data</b> dialog supports worksheet/column alias in the conditional statement.  You can test the condition by clicking the <b>Test -- select if true</b> button before extracting the data.
</p>
<h3><a name="New_Range_Selector_for_Selecting_Data_from_Graphs"></a><span class="mw-headline">New Range Selector for Selecting Data from Graphs</span></h3>
<p>New Region Data Selector tool<a  class="image"><img alt="Regional Data Selector tool.png" src="../images/Features_that_were_changed/Regional_Data_Selector_tool.png" width="23"  /></a> helps to select data from active plot or all data plots.  You can hit the space key to switch between its rectangle mode and freehand mode.
</p>
<h3><a name="Keyboard_Controls_for_Data_Selector"></a><span class="mw-headline">Keyboard Controls for Data Selector</span></h3>
<p>When you use the Data Selector tool and you have selected on of the Data Markers (left or right), Keyboard access to moving the markers has changed:
</p>
<ul><li> Use Tab to toggle between the Left and the Right marker. (Previously used Left Arrow and Right Arrow.)</li>
<li> Left Arrow and Right Arrow moves the selected marker. (Previously selected left and right markers.)</li>
<li> Shift+Right Arrow and Shift+Left Arrow moves the markers in steps of 5.</li></ul>
<p>Ctrl+Left Arrow and Ctrl+Right Arrow still moves the selected marker one step.
</p>
<h3><a name="The_Annotation_Tool"></a><span class="mw-headline">The Annotation Tool</span></h3>
<p>The Annotation tool is used to label a data point. Click on a data point to create a text label object with the point coordinates and an arrow connecting the selected data point to the label.  When the label is moved, the arrow tracks the label keeping it anchored to the data point.
</p>
<h3><a name="Data_Info_Tool"></a><span class="mw-headline">Data Info Tool</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Data Info Tool</b> appears whenever you use the <b>Data Reader Tool</b> in Reader, Annotation or Cursor mode.  It provides more information than the traditional <b>Data Display</b>.

<h3><a name="Data_Point_Size_Control"></a><span class="mw-headline">Data Point Size Control</span></h3>
<p>When using the <b>Data:Move Data Points</b> option, you can use the following system variable
</p>
<code><pre>
@MDS
</pre></code>
<p>to control the symbol size during moving of the data points. By default it is -1, which translates into size 12 if less then 10 data points, size 6 otherwise. 
If @MDS is positive its value will be used as symbol size regardless of number of points.

<h3><a name="Polar_Plots"></a><span class="mw-headline">Polar Plots</span></h3>
<p>ID 2306, 9867
</p><p>The order of the R and Theta columns have been reversed. Before this change, you needed to put data into A(X) B(Y) as A(theta) B(r). In Origin 8, the worksheet is structured into the more conventional A(X)B(Y) as A(r) B(theta). Older projects will still open in Origin 8 looking the same, but if you open an Origin 8 polar plot into an earlier version, you will see the data list displayed differently.
</p>
<h3><a name="How_do_I_control_Text_Color.3F"></a><span class="mw-headline">How do I control Text Color?</span></h3>

<h3><a name="What_is_the_red_rectangle_in_my_graph_legend.3F"></a><span class="mw-headline">What is the red rectangle in my graph legend?</span></h3>
<p>This "red rectangle in the legend" is an <b>active dataset</b> indicator. It is controlled by the <b>Indicate Active Dataset</b> check box on the Legends/Titles tab of the Graph level of the Plot Details dialog box. 
</p><p>This check box existed in previous versions and when checked, as it is now by default, you can click on any plot symbol in the legend to make the associated data plot active.  Clicking on the legend makes it easier to change active dataset.  Alternatively, you can go to the Data menu and select the correct dataset by name. 
</p><p>The <b>Indicate Active Dataset</b> graph property is saved with the system theme, so if you uncheck the <b>Indicate Active Dataset</b> check box and resave the template, the property will still be On when you plot into this template.  You'd have to edit or clear the graph system theme.

</p>
<h3><a name="Contour_plot_from_XYZ_worksheet_data"></a><span class="mw-headline">Contour plot from XYZ worksheet data</span></h3>
<p>In Origin 8, besides plotting a contour from a matrix, you can now plot directly from XYZ worksheet data. This kind of plot uses a triangulation algorithm to interpolate contour lines and supports both a <b>Data boundary</b> and a <b>Layer boundary</b>.
</p><p>This kind of contour plot also support polar coordinates (<b>Plot: Contour: r(X) theta(Y) Z Polar Contour</b>)
</p>
<h3><a name="Stacked_Lines_by_Y_Offset"></a><span class="mw-headline">Stacked Lines by Y Offset</span></h3>
<p>To display spectrums, you may be interested in looking at the general shape and less concerned about the Y offset. You can use the <i>Stack Lines by Y Offsets</i> (<b>Plot: Multi-Curves: Stack Lines by Y Offsets</b>) to create such curves.
</p>
<h3><a name="Improved_Merge_Graph_Windows_tool"></a><span class="mw-headline">Improved Merge Graph Windows tool</span></h3>
<p>You can use the new merge graph tool (<b>Graph: Merge Graph Window</b>) to choose which windows to merge, how to arrange these plots and preview the result.
</p>

<p>You can use Long Names, Units, Parameters in auto legend.  Open the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog.  Select the graph.  Click the <b>Legend/Titles</b> tab and select <i>Translation Mode</i> from the drop-down list.
</p>
<h3><a name="Layer_Naming"></a><span class="mw-headline">Layer Naming</span></h3>
<p>It is possible to name a graph layer with the <b>Layer Management</b> tool.  Then you can see this name, instead of layer index, in the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog and the <b>Plot Setup</b> Dialog.
</p>
<h3><a name="Spline_Connection"></a><span class="mw-headline">Spline Connection</span></h3>
<p>The algorithm for connecting data points with spline (actually, cubic spline) is changed. Therefore, if you create a spline connected graph in Origin 8 and another spline connected graph with the same dataset and the same styles in Origin 7.5, you may have two graphs that look different. Both graphs are correct. 
</p><p>Spline connection uses a cubic spline curve across two data points to connect them. In fact, there could be countless cubic spline curves across the two data points. We can choose any one of them. The method for choosing the curve in Origin 8 is different from that in Origin 7.5, making spline-connected graphs in Origin 8 different from spline-connected graphs in Origin 7.5.

</p>
<h3><a name="Accessing_File_Information_for_Imported_Files"></a><span class="mw-headline">Accessing File Information for Imported Files</span></h3>
<p>In version 7.5, once a file has been imported into a worksheet (using ASCII Import or Import Wizard) information pertinent to the file such as file name, file date etc were stored in the worksheet page under an ASCII storage area. This area was then accessible from script window by typing<br /><span style="color:blue"><i>page.info.=</i></span><br />
</p><p>The information was also accessible from the GUI from a text label. When editing a text label with in-place editing, one could right click and select <span style="color:blue"><b>Insert Info Variable</b></span>, or press <span style="color:blue"><b>CTRL-H</b></span> to bring up a dialog and from that dialog one could select the file information (or any import variables extracted from header)and insert them into the label.
</p><p><br />
The above works in 8.0 as well. But in addition to the above, the following is also supported in 8.0:
</p><p>The information corresponding to each imported file is also saved into a binary area of the page storage. This binary area holds separate information on each file that was imported into the workbook. In contrast, the ASCII storage area carried over from 7.5 gets over written any time another file is imported into the same book.
</p><p>The binary storage area contains additional information such as import date, data range, and also information on settings used to perform the import. This information is accessible to user and also used by Origin to perform re-importing of same file etc.
</p><p>From the GUI, both the ASCII and binary storage areas can be viewed using the workbook organizer (right click on workbook title and select <span style="color:blue"><b>Show Organizer</b></span>). The binary storage area has an <span style="color:blue"><b>Imported Files</b></span> node which contains subnodes for each imported file, named with the file name.
</p><p>From a GUI point of view, there is no difference whether user wants to access the information in the ASCII storage area or the binary storage area.
</p><p>Information from either storage area can be inserted into any text label. When the <span style="color:blue"><b>Insert Info Variable</b></span> dialog is brought up from a text label in version 8, information corresponding to all workbooks of all data plots are accessible to the user, both from the ASCII and from the binary storage area. The binary area will be listed as File1, File2 etc for each file that has been imported into the workbook.
</p>
<h4><a name="Formatting_Date_Information_in_Text_Labels"></a><span class="mw-headline">Formatting Date Information in Text Labels</span></h4>
<p>The file date, and the newly added import date, along with other such date information, are all stored as Julian Date, both in ASCII and binary storage areas in O8, similar to how it was stored in ASCII area of 7.5. The difference is that when viewing this information in workbook organizer, the binary area dates are displayed in a nice format, such as<br /> <span style="color:blue"><b>8/9/2007 13:57:57</b></span>.
</p><p>When such dates, either from ASCII or binary areas, are inserted as link (by checking the <span style="color:blue"><b>Insert as Link</b></span> check box in the dialog) <span style="color:blue"><b>Insert Info Variable</b></span> dialog, the resulting string will show the Julian date. The text label will then contain literal text such as below, for example, where the file date from the 1st file from binary area was inserted as link:<br /><span style="color:blue"><i>%(1, @W,SYSTEM.IMPORT.FILEDATE)</i></span>
</p><p>User can format this to show a desirable date/time format, by changing it to, for example:<br /><span style="color:blue"><i>$(%(1, @W,SYSTEM.IMPORT.FILEDATE),D1)</i></span><br />
which will then display, for example, as<br />
<span style="color:blue"><b>Wednesday, August 08, 2007</b></span>
</p><p>Note that the <span style="color:blue"><b>1</b></span> in <span style="color:blue"><b>D1</b></span> above corresponds to the 2nd entry in the Display drop-down for Date formatting which is accessible in the Column Properties dialog
</p>
<h4><a name="Formatting_Date_Information_in_Worksheet_Cells"></a><span class="mw-headline">Formatting Date Information in Worksheet Cells</span></h4>
<p>When you right click inside a worksheet cell in a workbook that contains information on imported files, there is an <span style="color:blue"><b>Insert Variable</b></span> context menu, which has been newly added in version 8. This context menu brings up the same <span style="color:blue"><b>Insert Info Variables</b></span> dialog which can be used to insert various file related information. Note that when inserting file date or any date information, again the date is inserted as Julian date. 
</p><p>User then has two options on formatting that date information. One way is to right click just inside that cell and select <span style="color:blue"><b>Format Cell</b></span> which can then be used to set the display format of just that cell to Date, with desirable selection from the <span style="color:blue">"Display"</span> drop-down. Another way is to format the entire column that contains the cell using the <span style="color:blue"><b>Column Properties</b></span> dialog. In this case all cells in that column are of course converted to Date format, but in this case user can also type in a custom date format string instead of being limited to the choices available in the Display drop-down. The custom display formatting is saved with the column and thus with the Origin Project and other customers who open the project will then see the same display string.
</p>
<h4><a name="Using_impinfo_X-Function"></a><span class="mw-headline">Using impinfo X-Function</span></h4>
<p>One exception to the above formatting requirement is the following:
</p><p>If you use the command or script windows, and then make use of the <span style="color:blue"><b>impinfo</b></span> X-Function, this X-Function can get the import file information from the binary storage area, into a LabTalk tree variable. Thus for example, after importing a file, one can go to the command window and type:<br /><span style="color:blue"><i>impinfo trInfo:=mytree</i></span>
</p><p>This will place the information from the binary storage area corresponding to the last imported file, into the LabTalk tree variable <span style="color:blue"><b>mytree</b></span>.
Then user can access variables from the tree such as:<br />
<span style="color:blue">
<i>&gt;&gt;string mydate$=mytree.info.importdate$<br /></i>
&gt;&gt;mydate$=<br />
8/9/2007 14:13:09<i></span></i>
</p><p>And in this case the information in this tree variable is already in a "desirable" date format, which is the same format used to display the date in the workbook organizer.
</p>
<h4><a name="Creating_Analysis_Templates"></a><span class="mw-headline">Creating Analysis Templates</span></h4>
<p>When you create an <span style="color:blue"><b>Analysis Template</b></span> by performing import, analyzing the data, then clearing the data, and saving the book as an OGW object for future repeat use, you may want to use some information from the import such as import date, or header variables etc, in your analysis template.
</p><p>In such a situation, one should make use of the information from the <span style="color:blue"><b>page.info</b></span> ASCII storage area of the workbook page rather than the individual file nodes in the binary storage area. This is because when the <span style="color:blue"><b>Analysis Template</b></span> is used in the future and a new file is imported, only the ASCII storage area information gets updated. The binary storage area gets appended with new branch for the new file and so any links placed in the Analysis Template will still point to the old file's binary area and will not get updated.
</p><p>As an example, see the <span style="color:blue"><b>Result Summary</b></span> sheet of <span style="color:blue"><b>autofit.ogw</b></span> analysis template example accessible from the <span style="color:blue"><b>File|Recent Books</b></span> menu item.

</p><p>ReImport is designed to be used when you have an external application that is saving your data to the same file by either replacing existing data or appending additional data. The ReImport gets the latest values in that file.

When you first import your data, use the <span style="color:blue">Options</span> to set <span style="color:blue">Partial Import Options</span> to bring in only the portion of data that helps you determine suitability. If the data meets your criteria, then choose <span style="color:blue">File&#160;: Import&#160;: ReImport by Changing Options</span> and turn off Partial Import options to bring in the whole file.

<h3><a name="Default_and_Custom_Colors"></a><span class="mw-headline">Default and Custom Colors</span></h3>
<p>Previous to Origin 8, Origin used a Color Palette dialog where users could edit Origin's
default palette of 24 colors and add 16 user-defined colors. The color information was
saved in ORIGIN.INI in the [Color] section as a name and Red Green Blue (RGB) values.
When used to color an Origin object, Origin stored only the index from this list and not
the actual RGB values. This produced problems with shared project files&#160;:
</p><p><br />
</p>
<ol><li>  Since many Origin Templates have used some of the default 24 colors, re-ordering or editing these colors would show up in these Templates automatically - often unexpectedly.</li>
<li>  Since a particular computer may have no user-defined colors or may have modified these colors for their own use, the same project viewed on two different computers may have different colors.</li></ol>
<p><br /> 
Origin 8 still has a default palette of 24 colors, but these colors cannot be edited. There are
still 16 user-defined colors as well, but the editor for these colors is the Windows Color dialog,
and when these colors are used by Origin, the full RGB value is stored rather than an index.

<br />
(<span style="color: red">2</span>) If you had opened a Table worksheet in 7.5, the number of rows displayed in Origin 8 may increase.

<h3><a name="File_Size"></a><span class="mw-headline">File Size</span></h3>
<p>8.1 added a feature that significantly reduces file size where data consists of many long strings. Such files saved in 8.1 may not show all the data when opened in earlier versions. To support older versions (at the expense of increased file size) set the System Variable @LSSP = 100.
</p>
<h3><a name="New_package_file"></a><span class="mw-headline">New package file</span></h3>
<p>The <i>Package Manager</i> (<b>Tools: Package Manager</b>) allows you pack your Origin files and share with other Origin user. The extended name for new package is .OPX, which is different from previous version, .OPK. OPK files can still be used in Origin 8 but the previous Origin will not recognize .OPX files.

<h3><a name="FFT_Does_Not_Pad.2FTruncate_Data_to_Power_of_2"></a><span class="mw-headline">FFT Does Not Pad/Truncate Data to Power of 2</span></h3>
<p>In Origin 7.5, the first step in Origin's calculation of the FFT is to make the number of data points an integral power of 2.  But in Origin 8, data is not padded before FFT is performed on it.
</p>
<h3><a name="Time-Frequency_Analysis_and_Wavelet_Analysis"></a><span class="mw-headline">Time-Frequency Analysis and Wavelet Analysis</span></h3>
<p>STFT (short-time Fourier transform) tool can be used to analysize how frequency changes with time.  This tool can be opened by selecting <b>Analysis: Signal Processing: FFT: STFT</b> from the Origin menu.
</p><p>Wavelet analysis tools include discrete wavelet decomposition, continuous wavelet transform, etc.  They can be found in the <b>Analysis: Signal Processing: Wavelet</b> menu.
</p>
<h3><a name="2D_Signal_Analysis"></a><span class="mw-headline">2D Signal Analysis</span></h3>
<p>Tools for analyzing 2D signals include 2D FFT/IFFT, 2D correlation, 2D wavelet decomposition/reconstruction.
</p>
<h3><a name="Deconvolution"></a><span class="mw-headline">Deconvolution</span></h3>
<p>In Origin 7.5, the response data set used for deconvolution should meet the following requirements:
</p>
<ul><li>The response data set should consist of an odd number of points and be a representative sample of a symmetric function. </li>
<li>The number of points, r, in the response data set must be less than half the number of points, s, in the signal data set.  (The last r points, and, to a lesser extent, the first r points, of the s points in the result are of no value.  Therefore, 2*r should be much less than s.)</li>
<li>The sum of the points in the response curve should be unity in order to retain the amplitude of the original data set.  </li></ul>
<p>However, in Origin 8, such requirements are not necessary.
</p>
<h3><a name="Improved_Smoothing_Tool"></a><span class="mw-headline">Improved Smoothing Tool</span></h3>
<p>Although no new method is introduced, each smoothing method is improved in Origin 8.  For example, boundary condition support is added when Adjacent-Averaging, Savitzky-Golay or Percentile Filter (Median Filter) is chosen.  User is required to enter <i>Number of Points</i> for the FFT-Filtering method.  However, in Origin 8, this is replaced by a more intuitive and more commonly-used <i>cut-off frequency</i>. 
</p><p>For Adjacent-Averaging, you can opt to use the weighted averaging.
</p><p>Median filter method is replaced by percentile filter.  The latter allows more agility so you can also use it to detect the envelope of the input signal, etc.
</p><p>For FFT Filter, you can choose whether to use the low-pass parabolic filter which is used in Origin 7.5, or the improved low-pass parabolic filter using new algorithm, but it is available only from script.. And you can also choose whether to subtract a baseline before fft filtering is used, but it is also available only from script.
</p><p>Note: 2D smoothing is removed in Origin 8.

<h3><a name="Preview_Support_in_Dialogs_of_Some_Signal_Processing_Tools"></a><span class="mw-headline">Preview Support in Dialogs of Some Signal Processing Tools</span></h3>

<h3><a name="Baseline_and_Peaks_Tool_Can_Be_Started_from_Workbook"></a><span class="mw-headline">Baseline and Peaks Tool Can Be Started from Workbook</span></h3>
<p>In Origin 7.5, all spectroscopy tools must be started when a graph is active.  However, in Origin 8, the <b>Baseline and Peaks</b> Tool can be opened when a workbook is active.  You can select the data to be analyzed and choose <b>Analysis: Spectroscopy: Baseline and Peaks</b> from the Origin menu.  Origin plots the data in the graph and starts the Baseline and Peaks Tool.
</p>
<h3><a name="New_Method_for_Creating_Baseline"></a><span class="mw-headline">New Method for Creating Baseline</span></h3>
<p><b>User Rectangles</b> or <b>Use Data Points Outsize Window</b> is a new method for creating baselines that can be used in the <b>Baseline and Peaks</b> tool and the <b>Create Baseline</b> Tool.  When this method is chosen, several rectangles are added to the graph and you can resize and move them.  Then, data points outside these rectangles are used to create a baseline, according to the connection type you have specified.
</p>
<h3><a name="New_Methods_for_Picking_Peaks"></a><span class="mw-headline">New Methods for Picking Peaks</span></h3>
<p>Origin 7.5 searches peaks with moving rectangles.  In Origin 8, two new methods are added.  One locates peaks using local maximum values.  The other utilizes first derivative to find the peaks.
</p>
<h3><a name="Smoothing_Can_Be_Performed_before_Peak_Finding"></a><span class="mw-headline">Smoothing Can Be Performed before Peak Finding</span></h3>
<p>No matter which peak picking method is selected, you are allowed to specify a <i>Smoothing Point</i> with the peak finding X-Function.  If this number is not 0, smoothing is performed to the data before the peak finding is carried out.
