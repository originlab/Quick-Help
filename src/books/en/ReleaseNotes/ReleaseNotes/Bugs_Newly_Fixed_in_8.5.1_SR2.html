<td>Some cell values went missing when copying and pasting parameters from the summary table after fitting
</td>
<td>Origin generates a hierarchy result sheet after performing a Nonlinear Curve Fit.  This sheet includes a Summary table.  In SR0, when a user copied values from this Summary table and pasted into another worksheet, some cell values would be missing.  This behavior did not occur when Paste Link was used.

<td>ORG-2988
</td>
<td>Paste-link values from fit results tables were turning to missing values when performing change parameter operations.
</td>
<td> After an analysis or fitting, a report table is created in a graph.  This table has an intermediate table associated with it.  A user may copy data from the intermediate table and Paste Link it to another worksheet for further analysis.  In SR0, if a user then used the Change Parameters dialog to modify the analysis, the paste-linked data became a missing value.

<td> ORG-3040
</td>
<td> Incorrect LabTalk script in Script After Fitting section of FDF caused Origin to freeze
</td>
<td> A Fitting Function (FDF) file is a kind of .ini file, which detects sections by [section name].  If a user writes code for Script After Fitting with [Table1] or [Book1] at the beginning of a line, it is treated as a section.  In SR0, this caused Origin to freeze.  SR1 includes code that prevents Origin from freezing, but it is still recommended that users avoid such cases by defining a range variable in the script.

<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;"><span style="color: #008000;">// start with some wks with some text in column A</span>
loop<span style="color: #000000;">&#40;</span>n, <span style="color: #0000dd;">1</span>, wks.<span style="color: #000080;">nrows</span><span style="color: #000000;">&#41;</span>

<span style="color: #000000;">&#125;</span></pre> 
<p>This occurred because the variable N had been reserved for Short Name. In SR0, users could could work around this problem by changing N to NN in a script.  Beginning in SR1, G has been reserved for Short Name instead of N in 8.5.1 SR2 but is not accessible until 9.0.  Please refer to this wiki page for a complete list of currently reserved variable names:  <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Column_Label_Row_Characters.html" title="LabTalk:Column Label Row Characters" class="mw-redirect">LabTalk:Column_Label_Row_Characters</a>
