<p>Origin provides several built-in surface fitting functions under the Surface function category which can be used to perform fitting on 3D data. The surface fitting function is similar to the nonlinear fitting function. 
</p><p>Surface Fitting is only available in OriginPro.

<ol><li> With the matrixsheet active, select <b>Plot: 3D&gt; 3D Colormap Surface</b> to plot a 3D graph. </li>
<li> With the graph window activated, select <b>Analysis: Fitting&#160;: Nonlinear Surface Fit...</b> menu to open the <b>NLFit</b> dialog. Please note, if you started the fit from a matrix sheet, you have to select <b>Analysis: Fitting&#160;: Nonlinear Matrix Fit...</b> menu.</li>
<li>Select <b>Gauss2D</b> from the <b>Function</b> dropdown menu.
