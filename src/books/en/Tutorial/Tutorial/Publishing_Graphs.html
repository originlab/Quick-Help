<ol>
<li> Open the project file saved from <a href="../../Tutorial/Tutorial/Merge_and_Arrange_Graphs.html" title="Tutorial:Merge and Arrange Graphs">lesson four: Merge and Arrange Graphs</a>. Click to select the last graph window that you created.
<li> Use the menu <b>Edit:Copy Page</b>, or the shortcut <b>CTRL+J</b>, to copy the graph page. </li>
<li> Launch MicrosoftÂ® WORD, then press <b>Ctrl+V</b>. The graph will be pasted as an embedded object in Word.</li>
<li> Double-click on the graph in Word. A new instance of Origin will be launched. Note that in this instance, only the graph and data related to the graph are available in the project.</li>
<li> Use menu <b>Format: Page</b> to open the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog in the page level. Then in the right panel, change the background color by choosing the <b>Display</b> tab and setting <b>Color</b> as <b>LT Gray</b>. Click OK.</li>
<li> From the menu, choose <b>File: Exit &amp; Return to Document1</b>. This will close the instance of Origin, and the graph image in the document will be updated.</li>
<li> Repeat step 1. This time we will copy the graph page as an EMF image. Press shortcut keys <b>CTRL+C</b> to copy the graph page as an EMF image.
<table class="mtip"><tr>
	<td style="vertical-align:top"><img src="../images/Publishing_Graphs/Mini_bulb.png?v=44828" /></td><td><p>There is another tool <b>Copy Page as Image</b> that provides more options. Move mouse to the edge of graph page, the page level mini toolbar will pop up. Select <b>Copy Page as Image</b> button <a  class="image"><img alt="Button Copy Page as Image.png" src="../images/Publishing_Graphs/Button_Copy_Page_as_Image.png?v=74050" width="24"  /></a>.
<p>In the dialog that opens, you can select EMF or other formats from <b>Image Format</b> drop-down list.

</td></tr></table></li> 
<li> Then go back to the Word document, de-select the graph and press <b>Enter</b> to move to a new line in the document. Press <b>Ctrl + V</b> to paste the Origin graph as a picture object. To edit the picture, you can select <b>Format</b> tab, or right click the picture and select <b>Format Picture</b> menu to open the Format Picture panel.
<table class="mtip"><tr>
	<td style="vertical-align:top"><img src="../images/Publishing_Graphs/Mini_bulb.png?v=44828" /></td><td><p>When the Origin graph is placed as an embedded object in applications such as Word or PowerPoint, all the data associated with the graph are also saved with the Word document. This provides the flexibility of double-clicking and editing the graph in a new instance of Origin. However, if many graphs are placed as objects in a document, the document file size will become large if there is a lot of data associated with the graphs.
