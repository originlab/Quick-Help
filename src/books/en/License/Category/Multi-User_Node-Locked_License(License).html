<h1 class="firstHeading">3 Multi-User Node-Locked License</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Multi-User-Node-Locked-Lic</p>
<p>You have a <i>Multi-User Node-Locked</i> license if your serial number is: 
</p><p><i>x<b>F</b>xxx-<b>9</b>xxx-<b>76</b>xxxxx</i>, or <br />
<i>x<b>F</b>xxx-<b>6</b>xxx-<b>76</b>xxxxx</i>.
</p><p>If your serial number is: 
</p><p><i>xxxxx-<b>2</b>xxx-<b>79</b>xxxxx</i>, or <br />
<i>xxxxx-<b>3</b>xxx-<b>79</b>xxxxx</i>, 
</p><p>then you have a <i>Concurrent Network</i> license and the information on this page is NOT relevant to you.
</p><p>A <i>Multi-User Node-Locked</i> package entitles you to install or deploy Origin on a number of computers, based on your purchased license number. Each of these computers needs to get a license from the OriginLab website, and the license is computer-specific. If you want to replace the licensed Origin computer, you will need to deactivate the license before you can get a new one for the new computer.
</p><p><b>NOTE: This instruction is for Origin 2017 and later. If you have version 2016 or earlier, please refer to <a href="../../License/License/Multi-User_Node-Locked_License_for_Old_Version(License).html" title="License:Multi-User Node-Locked License for Old Version(License)">this page</a>.</b>

For multi-user node locked packages, OriginLab provides a mechanism to control which OriginLab web membership accounts can obtain a license for Origin installed with your serial number. This mechanism is intended to prevent unauthorized use of your serial number, ensuring that all licenses purchased by your organization are available to authorized members of your organization.
</p>
<h3><a name="How_to_Establish_the_Product_Key_Deployment_Mechanism_on_the_OriginLab_Website"></a><span class="mw-headline">How to Establish the Product Key Deployment Mechanism on the OriginLab Website</span></h3>
<p>As the Origin administrator, please complete the following steps to register your serial number, generate product keys and determine the method to deploy product keys to your users. Please complete this before notifying your users that the Origin software is available for their use.
</p>
<ol>
<li>After purchasing, you will receive an email containing your Origin serial number and a registration link. <br />In some distributor areas, you will receive a Registration Code from your distributors.
<li>Click the registration link to go to OriginLab website. You will be asked to log in or join. Log in if you have an account or create an account as needed. <br />If you received the Registration Code, please open OriginLab product registration page <a class="external free" href="https://www.originlab.com/reg" target="_blank">https://www.originlab.com/reg</a> manually to continue with step 3.
<li>After logging in, your serial number, registration code, and 3 options to deploy the product keys will be displayed on the web page. Select one of the following options and <font color="red"><i><b>give careful consideration to your selection as you will not be able to switch options once you begin the licensing process</b></i></font>:
<ul>
<li><b>I will obtain all license Product Keys myself</b><br />If you select this option, you will be responsible for licensing each Origin installation, either directly by going to each workstation, running Origin and entering the Product Key; or indirectly by distributing Product Keys to your users.
<br />This means that:
<ol>
<li>You will log into the OriginLab website using your account. 
<li>Click the "Manage My License(s)" link.
<li>Locate the relevant serial number in the table, and click the link. All product keys will be listed there.
<li>Complete licensing by running Origin on the workstation and using an available Product Key to complete license activation. 
</ol>
<li><b>I will approve user requests for license Product Keys</b><br />If you select this option, you will be given a URL by which your users can request a product key. Before sending the URL to your users, you will need to add user email fragments. 
<br />You will then:
<ol>
<li>Email the URL to your users.
<li>When they make their request for a product key via the URL, you will receive an email.
<li>You will then go to "Handle Product Keys request" page and assign product key(s) to a table of selected users. This will generate an email to the user’s account, containing a product key.
<li>The user will then install and run Origin and use the product key to complete license activation.
</ol>
<li><b>Each user will obtain a license Product Key</b><br />If you select this option, you will be given a URL to distribute to your users. Before sending the URL to your users, you will need to add user email fragments.  
<br />You will then:
<ol>
<li>Email the URL to your users.
<li>When the user clicks the URL, it will generate a product key that is emailed to the user.
<li>The user will then install and run Origin and use the product key to complete license activation. 
</ol>
</ul>
<li>Enter email fragments as needed.
<ul>
<li>If you chose <b>I will obtain all license Product Keys myself</b> in the previous step, you don't need to set up the email fragment.
<li>If you chose <b>I will approve user requests for license Product Keys</b>,
<ul><li>If you want to allow individuals that you approve to obtain licenses for your serial number,
<br />Enter your full email address that is present in your log in account. After finishing this process, you can then add additional full email addresses for your "approved" users (see the following tip). You can return to the OriginLab website at any time to add these email addresses, as long as you add the user's email address before they try to obtain a license. </li>
<li>If you want to restrict license access to any members of your organization, <br />Enter an email address fragment that is unique to your organization and that will ensure that only eligible persons are able to obtain a license.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you chose <b>Each user will obtain a license Product Key</b>, you can enter your full email address and add additional full email addresses later, or enter an email address fragment that is unique to your organization. See detailed description above.

<p>When you distribute Origin to your users, in addition to providing them with the installer and the serial number, you must also provide the URL to request a product key, as the product key must be entered during license retrieval. Also, you must tell your users that they must log into the OriginLab website during license retrieval, or join the OriginLab website if they do not have an account. Let the users know that they should enter their organization contact information, including email address, when joining the OriginLab website. 
</p><p>If they already have an account but it does not contain their organization email address (e.g. they joined using a Gmail address), tell them they must first update their account with the organization information. They must update that information by logging into the website and clicking the "View/Update my Profile Details" link.

<p>From Origin2018, different versions share the same licenses, which means that the newer version will inherit all license from the old version, along with their product keys and usage status. It makes the upgrade easier.
</p><p><font color="blue"><b>If you are the administrator of the package,</b></font>
</p><p>After your <a class="external text" href="http://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=support/DocumentationAndHelpCenter/Maintenance" target="_blank">Maintenance</a> renewal has been processed, your serial number will be upgraded to the latest version automatically. All license related settings of the previous version (including the mechanism to deploy the product keys and the email fragments) will be applied to the latest version. You can inform your users when you are ready. The following are some tips.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to OriginLab website (www.OriginLab.com). Log in. </li>
<li>On the Welcome page, click the "Manage my License(s)" link. </li>
<li>On the Manage my License(s) page, check the <b>Version</b> column in the serial number table to see if there is newer version available to upgrade.</li>
<ul>
<li><b>If yes</b>, inform your users to install and activate the new version with the same product key. Refer to <b>If you are the user of the package</b> &gt; <b>If there is new version available for upgrade</b> section below for detailed steps.
<li><b>If no newer version</b>, you can inform your users to use the same product key to obtain a new license for the current Origin with an updated Maintenance date. Refer to <b>If you are the user of the package</b> &gt; <b>If there is no new version</b> section below for detailed steps.
<li><b>If you want to reset a group of product keys</b>, refer to <a href="#Administrator_Tips:_If_you_want_to_reset_a_group_of_product_keys">this section</a>.
