<p>You have a <i>Multi-User Node-Locked</i> license if your serial number is: 
</p><p><i>x<b>F</b>xxx-<b>9</b>xxx-<b>76</b>xxxxx</i>, or <br />
<i>x<b>F</b>xxx-<b>6</b>xxx-<b>76</b>xxxxx</i>.

</p><p>then you have a <i>Concurrent Network</i> license and the information on this page is NOT relevant to you.
</p><p>A <i>Multi-User Node-Locked</i> package entitles you to install or deploy Origin on a number of computers, based on your purchased license number. Each of these computers needs to get a license from OriginLab website, and the license is computer-specified. If you want to replace the licensed Origin computer, you will need to deactivate the license before you can get a new one for the new computer.

<h2><a name="Administrator_Tips:_Before_you_deploy_Origin_to_your_users_..."></a><span class="mw-headline">Administrator Tips: Before you deploy Origin to your users ...</span></h2>
<p>For multi-user node locked packages, OriginLab provides a mechanism to control which OriginLab web membership accounts can obtain a license for Origin installed with your serial number. This mechanism is intended to prevent unauthorized use of your serial number, ensuring that all licenses purchased by your organization are available to authorized members of your organization.
</p>
<h3><a name="How_to_Establish_the_License_Access_Restrictions_on_the_OriginLab_Website"></a><span class="mw-headline">How to Establish the License Access Restrictions on the OriginLab Website</span></h3>
<p>As the Origin administrator, please complete the following steps to register your serial number and to establish license access restrictions for your serial number. Please complete this before notifying your users that the Origin software is available for their use.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Have your serial number and the associated Access Code available. These are provided on your license certificate, as well as your Origin DVD sleeve, and the inside cover of your Getting Started Booklet.

<li>Go to <a class="external free" href="http://www.originlab.com/" target="_blank">http://www.originlab.com/</a>.

<li>Click the "License/Register Origin" link under the Support menu.<br />
<a  class="image"><img alt="Admin1.png" src="../images/Multi-User_Node-Locked_License_for_Old_Version(License)/Admin1.png?v=43986" width="216"  /></a>
<li>Log in if you have a web membership account or create an account if you do not.

<li>If you have previously registered a serial number, you will see your Product Registration web page. In this case, click the <b>Register New Serial Number</b> button.

<li>Select the radio button "I want to register my Origin software" and click <b>Next</b>.


<li>Enter your Version and select/enter your serial number and click <b>Next</b>.


<li>You will now see a page asking you to enter the Access Code and one email address or email fragment. After completing this step, you can enter additional email addresses or email fragments as needed (see Step 9 below).
<ul>
<li>If you want to be the only person who can obtain licenses for your serial number, enter your full email address that is present in your log in account.
<li>If you want to allow individuals that you approve to obtain licenses for your serial number, enter your full email address that is present in your log in account. After finishing this process, you can then add additional full email addresses for your "approved" users (see the following step). You can return to the OriginLab website at any time to add these email addresses, as long as you add the user's email address before they try to obtain a license.
<li>If you want to restrict license access to any members of your organization, enter an email address fragment that is unique to your organization.
</ul>

</p>
<li>To enter additional email addresses or email fragments after successfully entering the first one, 
<ol>
<li>Click your log in name located in the top right corner of the OriginLab website (or log in, if you are returning to the website and have not logged in).

<li>Then on your "welcome" web page, click the License Access Restrictions link.<br />
<a  class="image"><img alt="Admin6.png" src="../images/Multi-User_Node-Locked_License_for_Old_Version(License)/Admin6.png?v=44250" width="188"  /></a>

<td><b>Note:</b>
<p>You are entitled to upgrade your Origin to the latest version during Maintenance. As the Origin administrator, we suggest you register the new version and set up the license access restrictions right after it is released. Once done, you can deploy it to your users whenever you think it's ready.

<h3><a name="Instructions_to_Provide_your_Origin_Package_to_Users"></a><span class="mw-headline">Instructions to Provide your Origin Package to Users</span></h3>
<p>When you distribute Origin to your users, in addition to providing them with the installer and the serial number, you must also provide the Access Code as it must be entered during license retrieval. Also, you must tell your users that they must log into the OriginLab website during license retrieval, or join the OriginLab website if they do not have an account. Let the users know that they should enter their organization contact information including email address when joining the OriginLab website. 
</p><p>If they already have an account, but it does not contain their organization email address (such as maybe they used a gmail address), tell them they must first update their account with the organization information. They must update that information by logging into the website and clicking the <b>View/Update my Profile Details</b> link.
