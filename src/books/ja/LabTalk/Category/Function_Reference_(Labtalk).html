<h1 class="firstheading">Function Reference</h1>

  <p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Function-Reference</p>

  <p>Each function returns either a single value or a range of values (a dataset), depending on the type of function and the arguments supplied. Unless otherwise specified, all functions will return a range if the first argument passed to the function is a range, and all functions will return a value if a value is passed.</p>
