  <p>Internal objects are objects which are constructed by Origin. There are two types of internal objects:</p>

  <p><span class="hcp1"><b>Window objects</b></span>. Window objects are visible parts of Origin child windows. These include visual objects created by Origin, as well as user created graphic objects and UIM objects.</p>

        <li>User <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Graphic_Objects.html" title="LabTalk:Graphic Objects">Graphic Objects</a>, including <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/UIM.html" title="LabTalk:UIM">UIM Objects</a></li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  </dl>

  <p><span class="hcp1"><b>Utility objects</b></span>. Utility objects are generalized objects. These objects do not have a visual counterpart in the Origin project. Utility objects allow you to set properties that affect the active Origin session. The default values for most of these properties are set in the OPTION.CNF file which is read when Origin is launched. Many default property values may also be changed during an Origin session in the <span class="hcp1">Options</span> dialog box (<span class="hcp1"><b>Tools:Options</b></span>).</p>

  <h3><a name="External_Object_Overview"></a><span class="mw-headline">External Object Overview</span></h3>

  <p>External objects are objects which exist in external DLLs. External objects are not window specific - they affect the entire Origin session. A number of external objects are already accessible in Origin. Additionally, you can create your own objects in user-defined external DLLs. This process is reviewed in the OriginPro Manual (OriginPro only).</p>

  <p>To list the current external objects and the DLL that each is mapped to in the Script window, use the <b><a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/DLL_(command).html" title="LabTalk:DLL (command)">DLL -l;</a></b> command.</p>
