        <p>This is an outdated way to run scripts and it SHOULD NOT BE USED. To run script files or portions of script files, use <a href="../../LabTalk/Script/From_Files.html#Running_an_OGS_File" title="Script:From Files">the <b>run</b> object</a>.</p>

  <p>Execute a script in a script file (.OGS) located in the current working directory by using the file name as if it were a command object. If a file is added to the working directory while Origin is open, you must use a <b><a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/Dir.html">dir</a></b> command for Origin to recognize the file as a command object. The command can take up to five arguments. Arguments are passed as strings and an individual argument can contain spaces if protected by parentheses. The current working directory can be changed by <b><a class="external text" href="../../XFunction/X-Function/Cd.html">cd</a></b> X-Function command.</p>

  <p>In the special case where no SectionName is given then</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Origin looks for a section named <b>Main</b> and executes it if found</li>

    <li>If no <b>Main</b> section is found, but code exists at the beginning of the file without a section name, then that code is executed</li>

    <li>Otherwise Origin does nothing and does not report an error</li>
  </ul>
