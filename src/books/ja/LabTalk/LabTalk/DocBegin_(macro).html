  <p>The <b>DocBegin</b> macro is triggered just prior to opening an existing document (project). The <b>DocBegin</b> macro is executed by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Clicking the Open <a class="image"><img alt="Open.PNG" src="../images/DocBegin_(macro)/Open.PNG" width="24"></a> button.</li>

    <li>Opening an existing project by selecting <b>File: Open</b> from the Origin main menu.</li>

    <li>Issuing the <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Document_(command)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" class="new" title="LabTalk:Document (command) (page does not exist)">doc -o</a> or <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Document_(command)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1.html" class="new" title="LabTalk:Document (command) (page does not exist)">doc -of</a> commands.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The <b>DocBegin</b> macro is unique in that a <b>define</b> statement for the <b>DocBegin</b> macro is contained in the file ORGSYS.CNF (found in the Origin software folder) which gets executed when projects are opened. Since ORGSYS.CNF is executed just prior to the triggering moment for <b>DocBegin</b>, you must either comment out this definition or modify it to define <b>DocBegin</b> as you wish. Otherwise, the default definition of <b>DocBegin</b> (which happens to do nothing) will be the one that gets executed upon being triggered.</p>
