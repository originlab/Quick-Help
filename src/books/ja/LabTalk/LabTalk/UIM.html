  <p><br>
  The <b><span class="OIndex">UIM</span></b> provides interactive control and display objects that you can place on any of your project’s windows. The objects can then be programmed to perform the desired actions. Once you have added your control and display objects to a window in your project, you can save that window as a template to access the object's functionality in future Origin sessions.</p>

  <p>To know how to program with <b>UIM</b>, please see more details in the <a class="external text" href="http://www.originlab.com/pdfs/UIM_Manual.pdf" target="_blank">Origin 7 UIM Manual</a>.</p>
