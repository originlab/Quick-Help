  <p>The <b>EndToolbox</b> macro is triggered after the <b>getpts [<i>options</i>] <i>npts</i> [(<i>message</i>)]</b> command has been issued and npts points have been selected. A point is selected when you (a) double-click or (b) select with the left or right ARROW key and press ENTER</p>

  <ul>
    <li>on a data point of the active dataset (for the Data Reader tool).</li>

    <li>on any point in the active graph window (for the Screen Reader tool).</li>
  </ul>

  <p><br>
  If you choose to define your own <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/PointProc_(macro).html" title="LabTalk:PointProc (macro)">PointProc</a> macro after issuing the <b>getpts</b> command, you must call the <b>EndToolbox</b> macro yourself after npts points have been selected or it will not be triggered. This is because the call for the <b>EndToolbox</b> macro is contained in the <b>PointProc</b> macro that is defined by Origin when the getpts command is issued. The <b>EndToolbox</b> macro is deleted immediately after it is triggered and executed. For more information, see the <a href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/GetPts_(command).html" title="LabTalk:GetPts (command)">getpts</a> command</p>
