<h1 class="firstHeading">Opening your Resource and Workspace Files</h1>

  <p>To open your resource and view your dialog in Microsoft Visual C++ activate the <b>ResourceView</b>&lt;/span&gt; tab in the <b>Workspace</b> window, expand the [+] next to your <b>resources</b> folder, expand the [+] next to the <b>Dialog</b> folder, and then double-click on the resource ID string of your dialog (or your tab or wizard page).</p>

  <p>To open files and view them in the Microsoft Visual C++ workspace activate the <span><b>FileView</b></span> tab in the <span><b>Workspace</b></span> window, expand the [+] next to your resource's <span><b>files</b></span> icon, expand the [+] next to the <span><b>Source</b></span> or <span><b>Header Files</b></span> folder, and then double-click on the desired file's icon.</p>

  <p>The Origin Dialog AppWizard creates and adds a source file (*.c or *.cpp), a resource file (*.rc), and two header files (*.h) to the Visual C++ workspace. In the above example, the source file HelloWorld.c contains template Origin C code to launch your resource in Origin, the resource file HelloWorld.rc contains Microsoft Visuall C++ resource commands, and the header file HelloWorld.h contains a template Origin C code implementation of a <span><b>Dialog</b></span> derived class also used to launch your resource in Origin. The header file HelloWorldRes.h contains the resource IDs for your dialog and is used by both Visual C++ (to construct the resource-only DLL) and by Origin (to launch your dialog).</p>

  <p>'</p>

  <p><span><b>Note:</b></span> The resource file (*.rc) is already open in Microsoft Visual C++ and can not be opened (again) as a text file without first closing the current workspace. Select the <span><b>File:Close Workspace</b></span> menu item to close the workspace and then select the <span><b>File:Open</b></span> menu item and browse to and open the *.rc file as a text file if you want to view the Microsoft Visual C++ resource commands.</p>
