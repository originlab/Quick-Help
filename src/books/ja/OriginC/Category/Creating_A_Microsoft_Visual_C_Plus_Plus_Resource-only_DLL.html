<h1 class="firstheading">Creating A Microsoft Visual C Plus Plus Resource-only DLL</h1>

  <p>This section describes in detail the general process of creating a resource-only DLL for use in Origin. Topics include using the <span><b>Origin Dialog AppWizard</b></span> to create a Microsoft Visual C++ project, making other Visual C++ project settings, and performing various Visual C++ operations such as adding controls to your resource, saving your resource, and building your resource.</p>

  <p>See the section <a href="../../OriginC/Category/Additional_Resource_Topics.html" title="Category:Additional Resource Topics">Additional Resource Topics</a> for a discussion of more specialized resource operations such as adding tabs to a tabbed dialog and pages to a wizard after the <span><b>Origin Dialog AppWizard</b></span> has closed, adding a graph or worksheet control (which displays an Origin graph or worksheet) to a resource, and manually defining (or re-defining) resource IDs in the Symbol include header file.</p>

  <p>See the section <a href="../../OriginC/DevKit/Accessing_Dialog_Builder_Resources_with_Origin_C.html" title="DevKit:Accessing Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C">Accessing Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C</a> for a discussion of how to access Dialog Builder resources in Origin with Origin C. Topics include the fundamentals of accessing Dialog Builder resources with Origin C classes, handling Dialog Builder (resource) related events with an Origin C message map, and a number of example Dialog Builder dialogs launched and controlled by Origin C.</p>

  <p><span><b>Note:</b></span> It is also possible to open a resource in Origin created using a resource editor/compiler other than Microsoft Visual C++.
