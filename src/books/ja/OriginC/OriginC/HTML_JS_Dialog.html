  <p>Origin C supports building dialog by using HTML, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. In such dialog, HTML is used to contain the elements (contents) of the dialog, and CSS is to control the presentation of HTML elements, including the elements' style, layout, etc., and then JavaScript can be used to control the elements dynamically. Also, one of the most important roles of JavaScript in such dialog is to communicate with Origin C.</p>

  <p>The advantage of such kind of dialog is that lots of 3rd libraries are available, and it is easy to build up a good-looking dialog such as the one below:</p>

  </dl>
