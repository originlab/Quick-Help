<h1 class="firstheading">Accessing Static Controls and Triggering Origin Events with Origin C</h1><p>The <span><b>ActiveLayer</b></span> example demonstrates how to access static controls in a Dialog Builder resource and how to trigger event handlers for various Origin events. To access the static controls in the Active Layer dialog below the example program uses the Origin C <span><b>Control</b></span> class. To trigger event handlers for various Origin events the Active Layer dialog uses several event macros defined in the Origin C system header file MsgMap.h. The example dialog is launched by executing the function <span><b>TestDlg</b></span> in the source file ActiveLayer.c found in <a class="external text" href="http://blog.originlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DialogBuilderExamples.zip" target="_blank">this zip file</a>, under the <i>\Dialog Builder\ActiveLayer</i> subfolder of Origin.
