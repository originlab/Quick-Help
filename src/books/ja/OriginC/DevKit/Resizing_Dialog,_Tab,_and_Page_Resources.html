</p><p>If you are developing a tabbed dialog or wizard, the Origin Dialog AppWizard will create your main dialog with a Picture control <a  class="image"><img alt="Resizing Dialog, Tab, and Page Resources image96.gif" src="../images/Resizing_Dialog,_Tab,_and_Page_Resources/Resizing_Dialog_2C_Tab_2C_and_Page_Resources_image96.gif" width="24"  /></a> already positioned on it. The Picture control serves as a placeholder for the tabs on your tabbed dialog or for the pages on your wizard.

</p><p>To decrease the size of your main dialog, you must first decrease the size of the Picture control on the main dialog - as the Picture control is nearly the same size as your main dialog. After decreasing the Picture's size, decrease the dialog size so that the Picture is as large as possible within the dialog (assuming you will not have a static area on the main dialog). Alternatively, to increase the size of the main dialog, drag the edges to the desired size and then increase the size of the Picture so that it is as large as possible within the dialog.
</p><p>Because the Picture control acts as a placeholder for the tabs of a tabbed dialog or the pages of a wizard, when you change the size of the Picture control on the main dialog you must also change the size of the sub-dialogs (tabs or wizard pages). To do this, first check the current size of the Picture control by clicking on the control and making note of its dimensions listed on the right side of the status bar. Then activate one of the sub-dialogs and size the dialog so that it is 10 x 20 units less than the Picture control on the main dialog. For example, if the Picture is 104 x 76, size your sub-dialog so that it is 94 x 56. Repeat this step for each tab or wizard page.
</p><p><span><b>Note:</b></span> Any area of a tabbed dialog or wizard not covered by the picture control will be static (i.e. the static area of a tabbed dialog or wizard is visible no matter which tab or page is currently active). Tabs and pages must still be 10 x 20 units less than the Picture control when the main dialog contains a static area.
