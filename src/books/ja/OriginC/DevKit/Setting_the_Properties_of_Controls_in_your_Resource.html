<h1 class="firstheading">Setting the Properties of Controls in your Resource</h1><p>When you add a control to your resource, the control's <b>Properties</b> dialog displays.  If the <b>Properties</b> dialog does not display, open it by right-clicking on the control and selecting <b>Properties</b> from the shortcut menu.  The picture below shows a <b>Properties</b> dialog for a Static text control.

<p>For each control you add to your dialog, select or type a unique resource <b>ID</b> string in the ID combo box.  Use the notation, IDC_ControlName.  Type a ControlName that easily identifies the control.  You can type the characters in uppercase, lowercase, or mixed case.  Dialog Builder and Visual C++ will maintain the case of the characters that you enter.  In addition to the resource ID string, type the desired caption in the Caption text box (when available) and set/enter any other desired settings on any of the other tabs in the <b>Properties</b> dialog.
