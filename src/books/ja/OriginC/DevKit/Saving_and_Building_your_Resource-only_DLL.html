</p><p>To save all files in Visual C++ and build your resource-only DLL select the <span><b>Build:Rebuild All</b></span> menu item. Each time you make a change to your resources, you must re-select the <span><b>Build:Rebuild All</b></span> menu item for the changes to appear in your DLL.
</p><p>After you build your DLL, see the topic <a href="../../OriginC/Category/Accessing_Dialog_Builder_Resources_with_Origin_C.html" title="Category:Accessing Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C">Accessing Dialog Builder Resources with Origin C</a> to learn how to access your DLL using Origin C.
</p><p><span><b>Note:</b></span> Before you build or rebuild your DLL you must make sure that your DLL is not currently loaded by Origin. If you have accessed your DLL in the current session of Origin (even if your dialog <span><i>is not</i></span> currently open) you must first close Origin before rebuilding.
