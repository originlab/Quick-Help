<h1 class="firstheading">Programmatically Accessing a Dialog Builder Dialog with an ActiveX Control</h1><p>To learn how to launch and manipulate a Dialog Builder dialog with an ActiveX control first review the section <a href="../../OriginC/Category/Origin_C_Dialog_Builder_Examples.html" title="Category:Origin C Dialog Builder Examples">Origin C Dialog Builder Examples</a> and then follow the steps below. The steps below use Origin and Code Builder to launch and manipulate an example dialog with an ActiveX control.
</p>
<ol><li> Download <a class="external text" href="http://blog.originlab.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/DialogBuilderExamples.zip" target="_blank">this zip file</a>, extract it.</li>
<li> Start Origin and open Code Builder by clicking the Code Builder button <a  class="image"><img alt="Programmatically Accessing a Dialog Builder Dialog with an ActiveX Control CodeBuilder.png" src="../images/Programmatically_Accessing_a_Dialog_Builder_Dialog_with_an_ActiveX_Control/Programmatically_Accessing_a_Dialog_Builder_Dialog_with_an_ActiveX_Control_CodeBuilder.png" width="24"  /></a> on Origin's Standard toolbar.</li>
<li> Select the <span><b>File:Open</b></span> menu item in Code Builder. Check the Add to Workspace checkbox at the bottom of the Open dialog box and then browse to and open the sample files ActiveXDLG.c, ActiveXDlgCls.h, and ActiveXDLG.h in the <i>\Dialog Builder\ActiveXDLG</i> subfolder of the unzipped folder above. The source files are also added to the Code Builder workspace. Study the code as desired to gain an understanding of how to launch and manipulate a Dialog Builder dialog containing an ActiveX control.</li>
<li> In the header file ActiveXDlgCls.h locate the line of code below.<br /><pre>m_objActiveX = GetItem( IDC_AXD_VSFLEXGRID ).GetActiveXControl();</pre><br />The <span><b>GetItem</b></span> method of the <span><b>Dialog</b></span> class is chained together with the <span><b>GetActiveXControl</b></span> method of the <span><b>Control</b></span> class to attach the class data member <span><b>m_objActiveX</b></span> to a VSFlexGrid ActiveX control from ComponentOne Software. The ActiveX control has the resource ID IDC_AXD_VSFLEXGRID.</li>
<li> Select the <span><b>Tools:Rebuild All</b></span> menu item in Code Builder to compile and link all the files in the Origin C workspace.</li>
<li> Activate Origin and open the Script Window by selecting the Origin <span><b>Window:Script Window</b></span> menu item. Type <span><b>LaunchActiveXDLG()</b></span> into the Script Window and press the Enter key. The function executes and launches the Active X Dialog example dialog containing the VSFlexGrid ActiveX control.</li></ol>
