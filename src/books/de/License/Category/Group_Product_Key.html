<h1 class="firstHeading">How to Request and Use Group Key for Large Multi-User Node-Locked License</h1>

  <p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Group-Product-Key</p>

  <p>For the administrator of a large group, a campus-wide site license for example, we provide a unique Group Product Key that should make deploying Origin to a large number of computers easier.</p>

  <p><font color="blue">To generate the Group Product Key:</font></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Log into the OriginLab website.</li>

    <li>Click the "Manage my Licenses" link, then click the desired Serial Number.</li>

    <li>Click the "you can see all product keys here" link. You will find the <b>Request Group Product Key</b> button on the page that opens.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><br>
  The purpose of the Group Product Key is to free you from having to manually enter the key during activation.</p>

  <p><font color="blue">To make use of the Group Product Key:</font></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Save the Group Product Key in a text file and name it <b>PK.txt</b>.</li>

    <li>Put the file <b>PK.txt</b> into the folder where other Origin Setup files are.</li>

    <li>Run the Origin setup files to install.</li>

    <li>After installation is complete, start Origin. Note that the Group Product Key is pre-filled in <a href="../../License/License/License_Activation.html" title="License:License Activation">the License Activation dialog</a> and the license is automatically activated.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The Group Product Key in combination with the <a class="external text" href="http://originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Support/DocumentationAndHelpCenter/Installation/Multi-userDeployment/SilentInstall" target="_blank">Silent Install Method</a> allows you to install and license Origin automatically on every user machine.</p>
