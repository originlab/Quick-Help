  <p>From Origin 2018, different versions share the same license information. That is to say, new version uses the same product keys of the older ons. If you choose to upgrade Origin on the computer with older version installed, the new version will automatically activate by reading the license information from the old version. As you must have already registered version 2017, you can also log in to the OriginLab website, click <b>Mange My License(s)</b> link and view your product keys under your serial number.</p>
