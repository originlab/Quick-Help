  <p>OriginLab offers a Mixed Origin and OriginPro Concurrent Network Package where one server license can have both an Origin product line and an OriginPro product line. In such packages, OriginPro installed with an OriginPro serial number can check out an Origin Standard license to use Origin Standard features and can manually be switched back to OriginPro to use OriginPro features if an OriginPro license is available.</p>
