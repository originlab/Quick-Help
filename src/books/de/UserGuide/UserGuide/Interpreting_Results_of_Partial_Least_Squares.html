  <h3><a name="Cross_Validation"></a><span class="mw-headline">Cross Validation</span></h3>

  <p>This report only appears when you check to do Cross Validation. It gives summary statistics for fitting models using from 0 to the specified maximum number of extracted factors. If there are more than 15 independent variables, then we restrict the maximum number of extracted factors can only be up to 15; otherwise, the number of original independent variables can be up to. We can see one table <b>Cross Validation Summary</b> and another plot <b>PRESS Plot</b> are contained in this report section. These results will tell you the optimal number of factors of great interest. We have many other methods, such as K-fold cross-validation, 2-fold cross-validation, Repeated random sub-sampling validation and Leave-one-out cross-validation, to do cross validation. However, as for Partial Least Squares, we usually choose Leave-one-out method, which uses a single observation as validation data and leave the remains as training data each time, with the process stopping until each observation has already been treated as validation data.</p>

  <h4><a name="Cross_Validation_Summary"></a><span class="mw-headline">Cross Validation Summary</span></h4>

  <p>In this table, <b>Root mean PRESS</b> is the root mean of PRESS, which is the predicted residual sum of squares. From the table, we generally can see the values of Root mean PRESS start to (non-strictly) decrease to a minimum root mean and then increase to some value. At the time the minimum root mean is reached, the number of factors involved is the so-called <b>Optimal number of factors</b>. Actually, the information of most interest could be found in the notes below the table.</p>

  <h4><a name="PRESS_Plot"></a><span class="mw-headline">PRESS Plot</span></h4>

  <p>This plot shows directly how the minimum root mean is reached.</p>

  <h3><a name="Variance_Explained"></a><span class="mw-headline">Variance Explained</span></h3>

  <p>This section includes one table <b>Percent of Variance</b> and two plots <b>Variance Explained Plot</b>.</p>

  <h4><a name="Percent_of_Variance"></a><span class="mw-headline">Percent of Variance</span></h4>

  <p>This table offers results of the percent variation and cumulative percent variation explained for both X and Y. We can see that the more factors are involved the larger percent value for both X Effects and Y Responses.</p>

  <h4><a name="Variance_Explained_Plot"></a><span class="mw-headline">Variance Explained Plot</span></h4>

  <p>These two plots show <b>Variance Explained for X Effects(%)</b> and <b>Variance Explained for Y Responses(%)</b> respectively.</p>

  <h3><a name="Coefficients_Plots"></a><span class="mw-headline">Coefficients Plots</span></h3>

  <p>For each response in Y, the corresponding plot shows the coefficients of X based on the original data.</p>

  <h3><a name="Variable_Importance"></a><span class="mw-headline">Variable Importance</span></h3>

  <p>This plot explains each predictor variable using the mean variance in responses.This VIP value is a measure of the importance of a variable. We can see there is a reference line, which equals to 0.8, in the plot. A variable is considered 'important' if its VIP value is greater than 0.8.</p>

  <h3><a name="Loadings_Plot"></a><span class="mw-headline">Loadings Plot</span></h3>

  <p>The Loading Plot is a plot of the relationship between original variables and subspace dimensions. It is used for interpreting relationships among variables.</p>

  <h3><a name="Scores_Plot"></a><span class="mw-headline">Scores Plot</span></h3>

  <p>The score plot is a projection of data onto subspace. It is used for interpreting relations among observations.</p>

  <h3><a name="Diagnostics_Plots"></a><span class="mw-headline">Diagnostics Plots</span></h3>

  <p>For each response in Y, we have linear fit plot, residual scatter plots and normal percentile plot. These plots are used for model diagnosis.</p>

  <h3><a name="Distance_Plots"></a><span class="mw-headline">Distance Plots</span></h3>

  <p>The distance plots show distances to both X and Y model for the ith observation.</p>

  <h3><a name="T_Square_Plot"></a><span class="mw-headline">T Square Plot</span></h3>

And this T Square Plot shows scatter of these statistics.</p>
