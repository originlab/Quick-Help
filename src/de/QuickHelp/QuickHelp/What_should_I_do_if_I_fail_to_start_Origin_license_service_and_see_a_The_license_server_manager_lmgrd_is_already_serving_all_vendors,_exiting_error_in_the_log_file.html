  <p>If you try to start the Origin license server by clicking the <b>Start Server</b> button on the Start/Stop/Reread tab of LMTools, but get the following error on the status bar:</p>

  <p><font color="red">VD is starting, please check vendor daemon's status in debug log</font></p>

  <p>When you look into the debug log file, you may see something like the following:</p>

  <p><font color="red">18:13:21 (lmgrd) orglab already running <i>27000</i>@<i>ServerName</i></font></p>

  <p><font color="red">18:13:21 (lmgrd) The license server manager (lmgrd) is already serving all vendors, exiting.</font></p>

  <p><br>
  It is probably because you have configured two instances of OriginLab license service on the same server, so the 2nd one could not start.</p>

  <p><span class='headerInParagraph'>To troubleshoot this problem,</span></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to the Config Services tab. You will see all existed services listed in the <b>Service Nmae</b> drop-down list. Check if more than one services set to the same lmgrd.exe/Origin license files. If so, you can keep only one service and stop the others.</li>

    <li>Select the unwanted service from the <b>Service Nmae</b> drop-down list. Go to the Start/Stop/Reread tab. Click <b>Stop Server</b> to stop this service</li>

    <li>Now go to the Service/License File tab. Select the service you want to keep.</li>

    <li>Go to Start/Stop/Reread tab and click <b>Start Server</b> button. See if the service is started.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>If it works now, you can safely remove the unwanted service from LMTools:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Go to Config Services tab. Select the unwanted service from the <b>Service Name</b> drop-down list. Click <b>Remove Service</b> button to remove it.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><br>
  <span class='headerInParagraph'>If you can see only one service in the LMTools, but still have "VD is already starting" error, please try the following:</span></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Open <b>Task Manager</b> dialog.</li>

    <li>Go to the Services tab (you may need to click "More details" link to see the Services tab). All services on this machine is listed here. Search for the Origin license services you setup.</li>

    <li>If you find any, please right click on it and select <b>Stop</b> to stop them.</li>

    <li>Go back to LMTools. Try to restart the server again.</li>
  </ol>
