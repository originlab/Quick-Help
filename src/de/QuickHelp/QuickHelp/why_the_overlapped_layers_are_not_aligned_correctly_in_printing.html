  <p>Supposed you have a multi-layer graph, such as a stack graph, some of the layers are <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/Category/Linking_Layers.html">linked</a> to others. When you print this graph from Origin directly, you may find the overlapped layers are not aligned correctly. To work around the problem,</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Double click on the graph to open the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog. Select the children layer on the left panel and active Layer tab on the right panel.</li>

    <li>Change the children layer's <b>Units</b> to <b>% of Linked Layer</b> (this option is only available in the <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/Category/Linking_Layers.html">linked layers</a>), and then modify the <b>Layer Area</b> values to be more precise like 0, 100 etc.</li>
  </ol>
