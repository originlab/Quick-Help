<p>I am the Admin of a node-locked group (Serial number xFxxx-6xxx-76xxxxx) license. Some users have left our organization, and a new group of people need to use Origin. The best way to transfer product keys to the new users is resetting the group of product keys no longer used.
</p><p>As a benefit of maintenance service, you can log into your OriginLab web account, then select multi product keys and request OriginLab to reset them. In less than 12 hours, you will get a new set of product keys which can be used for the new members. You also do not need to deactivate the product keys on the old computers. 
</p><p>Refer to <a href="../../License/Category/Multi-User_Node-Locked_License(License).html#Administrator_Tips:_If_you_want_to_reset_a_group_of_product_keys" title="Category:Multi-User Node-Locked License(License)">this page</a> for details of resetting a group of product keys.
