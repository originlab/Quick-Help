<h1 class="firstHeading">5.62 FAQ-923 Error when trying to edit an Origin graph in MS Word: "The program used to create this object is Origin95"</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Error-editing-graph-in-Word-object-is-Origin95</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/4/2019</p>
<p>When you use <b>Edit: Copy Page</b> and paste a graph to MS Word, you can later edit that graph by double-clicking on the graph in your Word document. Using a mechanism known as Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), Word identifies the object as an Origin graph, then launches the graph in an instance of Origin, where you can edit the graph in the Origin environment, then <b>Exit and Return to Document</b>. You will then see that your embedded graph is updated in your Word document.
</p><p>Origin 2018 introduced new Unicode-compliant file types, including those for the Origin Project (OPJU) and the Origin Graph (OGGU). If you use Origin 2018 or later to embed an Origin graph in a Word document, then hand that document to a colleague who uses Origin 2017 or earlier, he or she will not be able to edit the Origin graph by OLE. Instead, your colleague might receive the message that "<i>The program used to create this object is Origin95. That program is either not installed on your computer or it is not responding</i> ..."
</p><p>While there is no remedy for Origin 2018 users other than to insert the graph as a picture, starting with Origin 2018b,  users can set the persistent <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#O">system variable <b>@OPJ</b></a> to use the older OGG file type when copying a graph page.  
</p><p><span class='headerInParagraph'>To configure Origin 2018b or later to copy the older OGG file type to the Clipboard</span>
</p>
<ol><li> Choose <b>Preferences: System Variables</b>.</li>
<li> In the <b>Set System Variables</b> dialog box, enter <b>Variable</b> = <i>OPJ</i> (no preceding "@"), <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#O">then set <b>Value</b> = <i>2</i> or = <i>3</i>,</a> then click <b>OK</b>.</li></ol>
<p>Now, the <b>Edit: Copy Page</b> menu command will use the older OGG file format by default, allowing users of older versions of the software to edit your graph in an MS Word document (Note that the graph type must be supported by the older Origin software).
