<p><br />
In Origin 8.x or above, when you set the number of <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Scale_2.html#Count">major ticks</a> of the axis, the tick label values will be calculated from axis scale and major tick numbers so that they won't always be integers.
</p><p>In case you want to make sure the the tick labels are integers, you could use negative major tick numbers. 
</p><p>For example you could use <b>-4</b> as the major tick number and it means rescale would try to get the best range which the tick label numbers are rounded up, and number of major ticks will try to be close to 4 but may not be exactly 4.
