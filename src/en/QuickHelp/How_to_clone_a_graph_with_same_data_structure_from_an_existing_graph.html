<p>With the desired graph window active, right click on the window title bar to select <b>Save Template As...</b> or go to menu <b>File: Save Template As...</b> to open <b>Utilities\File:template_saveas</b> dialog. Check <b>Mark as Cloneable Template</b> checkbox and select a data structure matching criteria from <b>Match Column by</b> drop-down list, and click <b>OK</b> button to save the graph as a cloneable template.
<br /><br />
After that you can clone a graph from this cloneable template with new data of same data structure. To do so, highlight all the data to be plotted, and go to menu <b>Plot: My Templates</b> and further select the saved cloneable template, indicated by a sheep icon in front to distinguish from an ordinary graph template, to make a graph with exactly same customizations as template.
<br /><br />
You can also further select <b>Template Library</b> to preview the template in the dialog and determine which template to be used for plotting.
