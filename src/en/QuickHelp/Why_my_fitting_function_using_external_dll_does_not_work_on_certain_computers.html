<p>Origin only preinstalled vcredist_x64_2008, 2010, 2012, and 2015-2019. So if you're using a different Visual Studio version, for example, 2013, to build the dll, it might not work properly on other machines if the vcredist_x64_2013 is not installed there.
</p><p>In order to make it compatible with such cases, the developer will need to set the <b>Runtime Library</b> to be <b>Multi-threaded (/MT)</b> under <b>Configuration Properties: C/C++: Code Generation</b> page in the properties of the project.
