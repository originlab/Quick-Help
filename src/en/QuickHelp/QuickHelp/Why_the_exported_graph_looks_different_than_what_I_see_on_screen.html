<h1 class="firstHeading">1.107 FAQ-649 When I export my graphs from Origin, the exported image looks different than what I see on screen. Why is that?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>exported-graph-different-from-screen</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/8/2019</p>
<p>The display of data in a graph window is controlled by a feature referred to as <i>Speed Mode</i>. This feature can be found on the <b>Size/Speed</b> tab at the layer level of the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog box by selecting <b>Format: Layer</b>. There are two separate controls, one for graphs plotting from worksheet and another for matrix:
</p>
<ol><li>Worksheet data, maximum points per curve.</li>
<li>Matrix data, maximum points per dimension.</li></ol>
<p>When enabled (it is often enabled by default), you can use <i>Speed Mode</i> to affect the display (and redraw speed) of your graph by reducing the number of data points used to plot each dataset contained in the layer. Graph windows that contain large datasets will therefore redraw much quicker when using this feature. It is important to note, however, that these controls do not affect the image you will obtain when exporting your graph. A separate control has been added for this purpose and is most likely the reason why your graph does not look the same on screen as it does in your exported image.
</p><p>Select <b>Format:Page</b> and then click on the <b>Miscellaneous</b> tab. The control is called <b>If speed mode is enabled for display, apply to graphic export as well</b>. If you want your graph to export using your current Speed Mode settings, enable this check box. If you want your graph to export using all your data, leave this check box unchecked.
