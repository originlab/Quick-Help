The <b>Nonlinear Curve Fitter</b> tool in Origin computes and reports <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/Category/Theory_of_Nonlinear_Curve_Fitting.html#Statistics"><b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> value</a> as one of the measures of goodness of fit. If a weight is included in the fitting process and the <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> is very different from 1, please examine if an improper weighting method is chosen. If the <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> value is much smaller than 1, it may indicate a too large weight. Vice versa.
</p><p><span class='headerInParagraph'>Why do you need check the weight method?</span>
</p><p>Typically <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> value is closer to 1, better a fit we get. If weight is involved during fitting, <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> close to 1 also indicates that the difference between observed data and fitted data has a similar magnitude of weight. When fitting with weight, <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> is calculated as follow:

</p><p>where <i>n</i> is the number of data, <i>p</i> the degree of freedom, <img src="../images/Why_is_my_Reduced_Chi-Sqr_value_very_different_from_1/math-8d62e469fb30ed435a668eb5c035b1f6.png?v=0" title="y_i" alt="y_i" class="tex"/> the <i>i</i>th y data, and <img src="../images/Why_is_my_Reduced_Chi-Sqr_value_very_different_from_1/math-65445646e7a531a2185d03b58b4d60e1.png?v=0" title="\sigma_i" alt="\sigma_i" class="tex"/> the <i>i</i>th error. When the number of data is large enough, <i>n - p</i> approaches <i>n</i>, and <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> is determined by the difference between source data and fitted data and the weight.
</p><p>Therefore, if <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> is very different from 1, it may indicate an improper weighting method. Origin provides several weighting methods, please refer to <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Fitting_with_Errors_and_Weighting.html">this page</a> for formula of each method. If the <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> value is much smaller than 1, it may indicate a too large weight. Vice versa.
</p><p><span class='headerInParagraph'>Quick Example</span>
</p><p>If you perform a nonlinear curve fit with the <b>Statistical</b> weighting method on a set of data and it generates a fitting result of <b>Reduced Chi-Sqr</b> close to 1, it indicates the fit result is good. Then you scale the y data by multiplied a factor of 10. Note that the <b>Statistical</b> weighting method takes ~y magnitude as error variation, the weight is also scaled by 10. However, for a random variable <img src="../images/Why_is_my_Reduced_Chi-Sqr_value_very_different_from_1/math-415290769594460e2e485922904f345d.png?v=0" title="y" alt="y" class="tex"/> with weight <img src="../images/Why_is_my_Reduced_Chi-Sqr_value_very_different_from_1/math-10e16c6a764d367ca5077a54bf156f7e.png?v=0" title="\sigma^2" alt="\sigma^2" class="tex"/>, the proper weight for <img src="../images/Why_is_my_Reduced_Chi-Sqr_value_very_different_from_1/math-531beb50ffb32d08756e6462c037c8e1.png?v=0" title="ny" alt="ny" class="tex"/> should be
</p>
<dl><dd><img src="../images/Why_is_my_Reduced_Chi-Sqr_value_very_different_from_1/math-2439d206a1702d9a5215c216a7654de5.png?v=0" title="E(nX-E(nX))^2=n^2E(X-E(X))^2=n^2\sigma^2\ " alt="E(nX-E(nX))^2=n^2E(X-E(X))^2=n^2\sigma^2\ " class="tex"/>.</dd></dl>
<p>So the <b>Statistical</b> cannot calculate a proper weight for the scaled data. The <b>Redcued Chi-Sqr</b> value which is scaled much larger than 1 also indicates this improper. To make <b>Redcued Chi-Sqr</b> close to 1 again, you should choose <b>Instrumental</b> or <b>Variance ~ y^2</b> method, which take ~y^2 magnitude as weight.
