<p>If you see an "error installing ikernel.exe" message when running the Origin Setup, this is usually caused by your Windows log in account not having installation permissions. Please refer to <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/Why_do_I_see_an_error_message_when_trying_to_install_Origin.html" title="QuickHelp:Why do I see an error message when trying to install Origin">this Quick Help</a> page for solutions.

<h5><a name="P2._Nothing_Happens_When_Starting_Origin"></a><span class="mw-headline">P2. Nothing Happens When Starting Origin</span></h5>
<p>The first thing to do is to download the latest service release from <a class="external text" href="http://www.originlab.com/demodownload.aspx" target="_blank">this link</a>, uninstall your current Origin and re-install with the newly downloaded installer. Make sure you have specified a new folder as <b>User Files Folder</b> during re-installation. If problem persists, you can find further solutions on <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/What_should_I_do_if_my_Origin_can_not_be_started.html" title="QuickHelp:What should I do if my Origin can not be started">this Quick Help</a>.

<h5><a name="P3._Very_slow_to_Start_Origin"></a><span class="mw-headline">P3. Very slow to Start Origin</span></h5>
<p>Several reasons would cause this problem. Check the following situations one by one:
</p>
<ul><li>If your User Files Folder (UFF) is set to a network path or roaming profile, change UFF to a local path. </li>
<li>Sometime printer driver can mess with Origin, reset the default printer to another one on the local machine.</li>
<li>If you have a Concurrent license and the Flexnet server locates far away (for example in another country), or in a network very slow to connect, Origin operation would heavily rely on the network status. To determine whether the network makes Origin slow to open in such case, try to break from network temporarily or borrow a license from server and then restart Origin, see if it starts faster.</li></ul>
<h5><a name="P4._Output_Error_Messages_When_Starting_Origin"></a><span class="mw-headline">P4. Output Error Messages When Starting Origin</span></h5>
<ul><li> If you are receiving missing DLL error messages when starting Origin, it means the required Microsoft DLLs by Origin are missing on your computer.

<h5><a name="P9._Saving_OPJ_is_Very_Slow"></a><span class="mw-headline">P9. Saving OPJ is Very Slow</span></h5>
<ul><li> If your Origin project size is very large, you may feel Origin is running slowly. The easiest way to speed up Origin is to break down your Origin project file into several smaller ones.</li>
<li> If your Origin project size is not so large (within 100M Bytes), but when you try to save the file it takes unreasonably long (~ several minutes), most probably it is a problem related to the printer. For this situation, you can try to change the default printer to a different one and resave the Origin project to see whether problem persists or not.</li></ul>
<h5><a name="P10._Origin_Does_Not_Allow_Saving_OPJ"></a><span class="mw-headline">P10. Origin Does Not Allow Saving OPJ</span></h5>
<p>Sometimes you may encounter the situation that Origin will not allow you to save current opj file, meanwhile the error message <b>Please close all open dialogs before closing Origin</b> will pop-up. But at this time, you cannot find any dialog that is open and thus cannot close it. <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/How_to_save_opj_when_there_is_a_hidden_or_minimized_dialog.html" title="QuickHelp:How to save opj when there is a hidden or minimized dialog">This Quick Help</a> page has provided two solutions for you to try.

<h5><a name="P11._Origin_Does_Not_Print_as_It_Shows"></a><span class="mw-headline">P11. Origin Does Not Print as It Shows</span></h5>
<ul><li> The first step to do before printing is to switch to <b>Print View</b> (by menu <b>View: Print View</b>) to guarantee what you see is what will be printed on the paper. </li>
<li> Sometimes what actually gets printed in the paper may differ from what you have expected, e.g., the layer dimension in printed page is incorrect, graph labels are shifting locations, etc,<a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/How_to_roubleshoot_printing_problems.html" title="QuickHelp:How to roubleshoot printing problems">this Quick Help</a> page provides solutions to each of the possible situations. </li>
