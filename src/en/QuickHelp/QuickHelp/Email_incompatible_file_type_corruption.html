<h1 class="firstHeading">5.61 FAQ-922 Preventing Corruption of Origin Files When Sending Via Email</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Email-incompatible-file-type-corruption</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/28/2018</p>
<p>Some users have reported that Origin files transferred as email attachments fail to open in Origin, or Origin reports errors <i>similar</i> to:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">File corruption<span style="color: #000000;">:</span> marker not at structure end<span style="color: #000000;">:</span> 000000000000001F
File format error. <span style="color: #000080;">Incompatible</span> file type or file may be corrupted.</pre>
<p>This issue can arise because some email clients and/or virus scanners may subtly alter Origin file email attachments rendering them corrupt to Origin.
</p><p>In order to mitigate this issue, it is <i>strongly</i> suggested that Origin files be zipped  (or otherwise compressed) prior to being attached to emails.
