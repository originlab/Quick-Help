<h1 class="firstHeading">1.146 FAQ-764 How to create a loosely separated 3D wire frame if your data points are dense?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>loose-3D-Wireframe</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 8/27/2015</p>
<p>When you create a <b>3D Wire Surface</b> or <b>3D Wire Frame</b> out of a large XYZ dataset (<i>Speed Mode</i> turned off), the plot will be condensed into bulk instead of well-separated grids since the data points are too dense.
<br />
To keep the genuineness of your dataset while effectively reduce the number of data points for display, you can firstly plot your XYZ data as a contour plot. Then right click on the contour plot and select <b>Generate Grid</b> to open dialog. In appeared <b>Generate Grid: xyzgrid</b> dialog, you can specify number of grid points along X and Y directions to make the reduction. You can even reduce the large XYZ dataset in a specified XY sub-region by setting the <b>Grid Range</b>.
