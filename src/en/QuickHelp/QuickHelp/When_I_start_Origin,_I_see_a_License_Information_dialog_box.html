<h1 class="firstHeading">6.33 FAQ-37 When I start Origin, I see a License Information dialog box asking me to enter a Host Name or IP Address, how do I proceed?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Lic-Info-Dialog-Shows-when-Start</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>When you start Origin, if you see the License Information dialog box requesting a Host Name or IP Address, then your Origin is managed by a license service.  If you have not yet completed the licensing process, then you must enter the Host Name or IP Address of the license server.  If you had been previously running Origin OK, but now you see the License Information dialog box, your license service may not be running or your computer cannot connect to the license service.  Contact your Origin administrator to resolve this problem.
