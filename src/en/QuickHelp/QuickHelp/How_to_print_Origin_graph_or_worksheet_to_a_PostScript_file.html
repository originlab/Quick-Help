<p><b>PostScript</b> (<b>PS</b>) is a document-generation language developed by Adobe®.  A PostScript printer includes a driver which interprets PostScript code and provides the printer direction in printing the document.  If you send PostScript code to a non-PostScript printer, you will generate pages of literal PostScript code.
</p><p>PostScript files (PS) contrast with<b> Encapsulated PostScript</b> (<b>EPS</b>) files in that EPS files are intended to be included in other documents (from applications such as Microsoft PowerPoint®).  EPS files lack some of the "overhead" commands needed to produce hard-copy output on PostScript printers because it is assumed that the document in which the file is embedded will handle this.  Consequently, EPS files cannot be sent directly to the printer as PS files can.
</p>
<ul><li>To create a PostScript (PS) file:</li></ul>
<ol><li>With the window active, select <b>File:Print</b>.  This opens the <b>Print</b> dialog box.</li>
<li>Select a PostScript printer from the <b>Name</b> drop-down list.  (You must have a PostScript printer driver installed.)</li>
<li>Select <b>Print to File</b>.</li>
<li>Click OK.  This opens the <b>Print to File</b> dialog box.</li>
<li>To modify the default extension, select <b>All Files</b> (*.*) from the <b>Save As Type</b> drop-down list.</li>
<li>Type the file name and extension in the <b>File Name</b> text box.</li>
<li>Click <b>Save</b>.</li></ol>
<ul><li>To print a PostScript file to the printer:</li></ul>
<p>Go to the DOS prompt.  Change from the current directory to the directory that contains the PostScript file (or include a path in the next step).
</p><p>At the DOS prompt, type:
</p>
<dl><dd>COPY <i>FileName PrinterPort</i></dd></dl>
<p>where <i>FileName</i> is the PostScript file name and extension, and <i>PrinterPort</i> is an available printer port with a PostScript output device.  This command prints a hard copy of your PostScript file.
</p><p>For example, to print the GRAPH1.PS file to a PostScript printer connected to LPT1, type the following at the DOS prompt:
</p>
<dl><dd>COPY GRAPH1.PS LPT1</dd></dl>
