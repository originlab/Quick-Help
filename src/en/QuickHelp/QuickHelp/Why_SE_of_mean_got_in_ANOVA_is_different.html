<p>In result sheet of <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/Category/Repeated_Measure_ANOVA_(OriginPro_Only).html">Repeated Measure ANOVA</a> tools in Origin, there is a table <b>Descriptive Statistics</b> The Means, SE of Mean values in the table are quite different from the ones we get in <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/Category/Statistics_on_Columns.html">Statistics on Column tool</a>, why?

<p><br />
It is because they in fact are two type of means though they have similar name in report, 
</p>
<ul><li> Repeated ANOVA tools
<dl><dd> In repeated measure ANOVA tools we report Least Square Mean (LS mean), which is means for groups that are adjusted for means of other factors in a linear model, such as ANOVA</dd></dl></li></ul>
<ul><li> Statistics on Columns tool
<dl><dd>In Statistics on Columns tool we report observed means, which are regular means that computed directly on your data without reference to any statistical model.</dd></dl></li></ul>
<table class="note">

<tr>
<td><b>Notes:</b> If your data follows <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/What_is_balanced_design.html" title="QuickHelp:What is balanced design">balanced design</a>, values of LS Mean and Observed Mean are the same. Only SE, LCI and UCI are different in the two tools, based on algorithm of LS Mean and Observed mean.
