<p>If you have data with a group column(s) (so call indexed data) and want to plot multi-panel graph by the group column(s), there are different ways.
</p>
<ul><li><a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Plot_by_Group.html">Cluster Plot</a> â€“ can choose to control XY axis scale of each panel separately or share them among all panels. </li>
<li><a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Trellis.html">Trellis</a> plot - has limitation of all XY axis sharing the same scale.</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Multiple_Panels_by_Label_Graph.html">Multi-Panels by Label</a> - doesn't support indexed data. You will need to unstack the columns before plotting.</li></ul>
<p><br />
If you want to adjust panel orders after plotting, don't do that in graph. The group column is set as categorical after plotting if the column is mostly text. If it is not set as actegorical automatically, set the group column by right-clicking and select <b>Set as Categorical</b>. And then you can adjust the categorical order. Panel order in the graph will update accordingly.
