<h1 class="firstHeading">3.38 FAQ-267 How do I speed up the fitting routine for the user-defined function with integration?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Call-GSL-to-SpeedUp-IntegrationFit</p>

<p>If your Origin C, integration by using NAG library, user-defined fitting function is not fast enough, you can call <a class="external text" href="../../OriginC/OCGuide/Calling_GNU_Scientific_Library.html">GSL library</a> to perform integration fitting.  
</p><p>Please refer to <a href="../../Tutorial/Tutorial/User_Defined_Fitting_Funciton_using_GNU_Scientific_Library.html" title="Tutorial:User Defined Fitting Funciton using GNU Scientific Library">this tutorial</a> for how to define the Origin C fitting function.
</p><p>Please refer to <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Using_External_DLLs.html">using external DLL</a> for how to create an external DLL fitting function.
</p><p><br />
There is an opx package, <b>FittingWithExternalDLL.opx</b>, in the folder of <i>&lt;Origin Installation Directory&gt;/Samples/Curve Fitting/</i>.  
</p>
<ol><li>Drag and drop it onto Origin to install it.  </li>
<li>A folder, <b>Fitting with External DLL</b>, is added to your User Files Folder, including the sample codes, help documentation, etc.. </li>
<li>The third example fitting function, which is commented out, in <b>FitFuncs.c</b>, will guide you to call the GSL lib to perform integration fitting using external DLL.</li></ol>
