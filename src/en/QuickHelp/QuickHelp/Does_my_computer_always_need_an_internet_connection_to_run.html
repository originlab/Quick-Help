<h1 class="firstHeading">6.24 FAQ-27 Does my computer always need an internet connection to run?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Run-Origin-with-Internet</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>No. You only need internet access for completing the node-locked licensing process (you can also license from a different computer, if your Origin computer does not have internet access). In addition, you need internet access to run <b>Help:Check for Updates</b>. This command allows you to check Origin's update center to see if a patch or updated Help file is available to your Origin.
