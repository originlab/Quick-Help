<h1 class="firstHeading">2.125 FAQ-1110 What should I do if Origin crashes when pasting link from Excel?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Paste-Link-from-Excel-Make-Origin-Crash</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 7/29/2022</p>
<p>When copying data from an Excel file and pasting it as link into an Origin worksheet (right-click on a cell and select <b>Paste Link</b>), if you find Origin freezing, your Excel file path may reach the Microsoft limitation that makes <b>Paste Link</b> have this issue in Origin. 
</p><p><span class='headerInParagraph'>To get around this issue, </span>
</p><p>Please shorten the full path of the Excel file. You can: 
</p>
<dl><dd><ul><li> Copy the Excel file to a location with shorter path, <i>OR,</i> </li>
<li> Rename the Excel file and sheet with a shorter name. </li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>The key is to ensure the combination of the file path, file name, and sheet name is fewer than 250 characters.

<td><b>Notes:</b>
<p>Copying data from Excel and then Pasting it into an Origin worksheet directly might also have a similar issue with file path being too long. This is something out of Originâ€™s control, as Excel might use its internal mechanisms to get the data from the file directly instead of putting a large amount of data on the clipboard.
