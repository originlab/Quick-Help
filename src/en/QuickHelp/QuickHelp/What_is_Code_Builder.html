<h1 class="firstHeading">4.4 FAQ-362 What is Code Builder?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>CodeBuilder</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p><b>Code Builder</b> is Origin's <b>Integrated Development Environment (IDE)</b> for building and debugging Origin code created in either <b>LabTalk</b> or <b>Origin C</b>. In addition to a workspace for editing multiple files with color coded syntax, <b>Code Builder</b> has <b>Output</b>, <b>Watch</b>, <b>Local Variables</b>, <b>Call Stack</b>, and <b>LabTalk Console</b> panels to assist in developing and debugging your code.
</p><p>You can open <b>Code Builder</b> from the <b>View</b> menu or by clicking Alt+4. In some cases, Origin menu options run <b>LabTalk</b> code and you can automatically open <b>Code Builder</b> to the location in the source file where that menu executes. For example, hold down a Shift and Ctrl key while selecting the <b>Plot: Statistics&#160;: Histogram</b> menu option. Rather than executing, Origin will open the PLOT.OGS file in Code Builder at the [Histogram] section where the code begins.
