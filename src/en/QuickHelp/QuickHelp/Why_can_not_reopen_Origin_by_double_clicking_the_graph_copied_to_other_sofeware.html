<h1 class="firstHeading">1.195 FAQ-914 Why can not reopen Origin by double clicking the graph copied to other software?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>reopen-Origin-by-graph-copied</p>

<p>If you use copy a graph from Origin 2018 or later versions, and paste to Word or PowerPoint and so on. Then share this sofeware file with the Origin users who are using pre-2018 versions. When they double click on the graph copied from Origin, Origin can not be open and show the following error message.
</p><p><a  class="image"><img alt="Open graph error message.png" src="../images/Why_can_not_reopen_Origin_by_double_clicking_the_graph_copied_to_other_sofeware/Open_graph_error_message.png?v=54731" width="578"  /></a>
</p><p>That is because, in Origin 2018 and later versions, we use a new file type <b>.OGGU</b> insert of <b>.OGG</b> for the graphs. But in the old version, Origin does not support this new format, so the graph can not be open in Origin. About new file type, plesae refer to <a href="../../GettingStarted/OriginLab/Origin_File_Types.html" title="OriginLab:Origin File Types">this page</a>. 
</p><p>In Origin 2018b and later versions, you can use the system variable <b>@OPJ</b> to control whether to save project file and copy the graph in a new file type by default.
</p><p>@OPJ=0  Save project to <b>New</b> file type, and copy graph page as <b>New</b> file type<br />
@OPJ=1  Save project to <b>Old</b> file type, but copy graph page  as <b>New</b> file type <br />
@OPJ=2  Save project to <b>New</b> file type, but copy graph page  as <b>Old</b> file type<br />
@OPJ=3  Both will use <b>Old</b> file type<br />
</p><p><br />
<b>To set the System Variables:</b>
</p>
<ol>
<li>Select <b>Preferences: System Variables</b> in the main menu. 

<li>In the <b>Set System Variables</b> dialog,  you can add the <b>OPJ</b> in a new item under <b>Variable</b> then enter <b>2</b> or <b>3</b> under <b>Value</b>. And click <b>OK</b> to save the setting.

<li>Then when you copy graph page to other sofeware using old file type OGG.
