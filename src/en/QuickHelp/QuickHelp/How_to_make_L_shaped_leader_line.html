<h1 class="firstHeading">1.247 FAQ-1038 How can I make an "L-shaped" leader line for my data labels?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>L-shaped-leader-line</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/5/2020</p>
<p>Leader lines are used to connect a data label and plot symbol. They allow you the flexibility to nudge data labels around to prevent overlap or over-crowding of labels.
</p><p>Origin has several leader line connection styles including <b>Polyline-Horz</b>, <b>Polyline-Vert</b>, <b>Step-Horz</b> and <b>Step-Vert</b> and how these connection styles work, is documented <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_(Plot_Details)_Label2_Tab.html#Connect">here</a>.
</p><p>What may not be intuitive is how to create an "L-shaped" leader line and to do that, you do the following:
</p>
<ol><li> Double-click on the plot to open Plot Details.</li>
<li> Click on the <b>Label</b> tab to the right side of the dialog.</li>
<li> In the <b>Leader Line</b> group, set <b>Connect</b> = <b>Step-Horz</b> and enter <i>0</i> in the accompanying text box.</li></ol>

<ul><li> Note that you can set leader lines globally for all data labels attached to a given plot. When doing so, all "special points" will register as <b>Connect</b> = <b>Auto</b>. </li>
<li> This does not prevent you from choosing a different connection style for any given special point. Simply highlight a special point in the list below the data plot in the left panel of Plot Details and choose another <b>Connect</b> option for that particular point. </li></ul>
<p><br />
The bottom line is that by setting one or more labels as <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/Category/Customizing_Plot_Elements.html#Customizing_Individual_Data_Points">special points</a>, you can have "L-shaped" connections for some data labels, straight connections for some, and polyline-vertical for others.
