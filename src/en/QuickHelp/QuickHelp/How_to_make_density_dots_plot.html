<h1 class="firstHeading">1.242 FAQ-1021 How do I make a scatter plot and apply a heat map look based on density of the points?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>RichText-for-WksHeader</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 4/16/2020</p>
<p>If you have XY data and want to make a scatter plot with dots colored by their local density, you can highlight the XY columns and select menu <b>Plot: Basic 2D: Density Dots</b> to make the plot.

<p>The graph is set to <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/doc/Origin-Help/Compare-PageView-Modes#Origin.27s_View_Modes" target="_blank"><b>Window View</b> mode</a> by default after plotting. The symbol size is autoatically set to <b>0</b> for the purpose of enhancing plotting speed. If you now change the graph to <b>Page View</b> from <b>Plot Details</b> dialog, it will show very differently (See below). To solve this issue and recover the display under <b>Page View</b> mode, you can simply increase the symbol size to <b>1</b>.

The conditions for the graph to be generated properly is as follows:
</p>
<ol><li> Graph page should be in <b>Window View</b> mode.</li>
<li> There is only one layer for the graph. If there are more then one layer, other layers need to be sharing the same area as the primary layer.</li>
<li> There is at least one Dots plot in the graph. Dots plot here means (a) Symbol is filled square. (b) Symbol size is zero.</li></ol>
