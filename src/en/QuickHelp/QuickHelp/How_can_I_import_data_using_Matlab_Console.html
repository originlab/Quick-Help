<p>In Origin, you can use <b>MATLAB Console</b> to import data from MATLAB and put them into worksheet or matrices with the graphical interface and issuing commands. On the other hand, you can export data from Origin to MATLAB workspace as variables to be called directly.  This feature requires both Origin and MATLAB be installed on the same computer. 
</p><p>To start the <b>MATLAB Console</b> tool, select <b>Connectivity: MATLAB Console</b> from the Origin menu to bring up the <b>MATLAB console</b>  dialog. Run <b>desktop</b>  in the panel. This MATLAB command will open the standard MATLAB desktop. After  importing  the data file into MATLAB,  go back to the <b>MATLAB Console</b>  dialog in Origin,  click <b>Import</b>  button to bring up the <b>MATLAB Import</b> dialog. Choose the desired data and click <b>Import as Matrices</b> or <b>Import as Worksheet</b> to import the data into Origin.
</p><p>Conversely, to export data from Origin to MATLAB desktop, select <b>Connectivity: MATLAB Console</b> from the Origin menu to bring up the <b>MATLAB console</b>  dialog. Run <b>desktop</b>  in the panel to open the standard MATLAB desktop. Now click <b>Export</b> button to initiate exporting data into MATLAB workspace.
