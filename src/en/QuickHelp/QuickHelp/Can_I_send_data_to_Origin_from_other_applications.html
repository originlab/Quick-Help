<h1 class="firstHeading">5.23 FAQ-506 Can I send data to Origin from other applications such as LabVIEW?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>send-data-from-other-application</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>Origin can function as an automation server (or COM, Component Object Model) whereby other applications communicate with Origin using methods and properties exposed by Origin. Any application that supports COM programming, such as Visual Basic, Microsoft Excel, National Instruments LabVIEW, or similar can function as the client application that connects with Origin. Such applications can exchange data back and forth with Origin and can send commands to be executed by Origin.
