<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 10/17/2019</p>
<p>To synchronize two sensor signals recorded with different sampling rates, you can use interpolation tool in Origin. Suppose you have four columns for two signals in the worksheet: X1, Y1, X2 and Y2, and you want two signals with the same sampling rate as X1. First add a new column at the right, set as X, right click on the column, select <b>Set Column Values</b> from the short-cut menu, and type <i>A</i> in the opened dialog to make a copy of X1. Select <b>Analysis: Mathematics: Interpolate/Extraploate Y from X</b> from Origin menu, choose the new column as <b>X Values to Interpolate</b>, X2Y2 columns as <b>Input</b>. The created Y3 (column F) will have the same sampling rate as Y1.

</p><p>If you have two signals of two Y columns with <b>Sampling Interval</b>,  first add a new column at the right, set as X, right click on the column, select <b>Set Column Values</b> from the short-cut menu, and type <i>xof(A)</i> in the opened dialog to make a copy of Y1 (column A)'s X. Follow same steps as above to create Y3 (column D), which has the same sampling rate as Y1 (column A).
