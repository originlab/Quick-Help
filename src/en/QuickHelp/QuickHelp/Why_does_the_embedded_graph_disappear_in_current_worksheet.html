<h1 class="firstHeading">2.111 FAQ-1025 Why does the embedded graph disappear or show partially in current worksheet?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Embedded-Graphs-disappeared</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 11/7/2019</p>
<p>Basically, you can <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Basic_Operations_on_Worksheet.html#Zoom_and_Pan_Worksheet">zoom out or pan the worksheet</a> to show the floating graphs embedded in the rightmost gray area of the worksheet.
</p><p>If the embedded graph still doesn't show or just show in partial, you can select  <b>View: Arrange Graphs</b> menu to get the graph back to the view. Please note, if there are no floating graphs, this menu will be disable.
