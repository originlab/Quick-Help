<h1 class="firstHeading">3.71 FAQ-308 Why is my FFT result different from that in Origin7.5?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>FFT-in-Origin75</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/24/2015</p>
<p>Origin 7.5's FFT tool pads or truncates the signal to ensure that its size is a power of 2 before FFT analysis. And it does not since Origin 8.0. So sometimes FFT result from a higher version may be different from that in 7.5 when the signal's size is not power of 2.
