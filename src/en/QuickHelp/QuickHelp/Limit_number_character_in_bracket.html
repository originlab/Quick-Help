<h1 class="firstHeading">4.28 FAQ-387 Is there a limit for LabTalk script length inside the brackets {} of an if, for, or loop statement?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>LabTalk-script-length-limit-in-bracket</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 9/21/2016</p>
<p>There is a limit to the length of script that can be included between a set of braces {}. The scripts between the {} are translated internally and the translated scripts must be less than <b>1140</b> bytes (after substitution).
</p><p>This size limit applies to any script placed between brackets {} and to any highlighted block of script in the Script Window. When writing script, remember to always keep your code in manageable blocks. A good way to handle this size limitation is to use the <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/Run_(object).html">run object</a>, which can execute script in a particular section of a file.
</p><p><br />
<b>Example:</b>
</p><p>If you have created a text file containing a section called <i>[insidefor]</i> and want to run the script of this section. Then, save the text file as <i>MyFile.ogs</i> in your Origin folder. The <b>run.section</b> command object will direct Origin to run the script located in the <i>[insidefor]</i> section of <i>MyFile.ogs</i>. The <b>for</b> command will allow the script to be run multiple times.
