<h2><a name="To_Export_as_an_Image_File"></a><span class="mw-headline">To Export as an Image File</span></h2>
<p>To export the whole worksheet as an image file, select <b>File: Export: As Image File</b> from the Origin menu when the worksheet is active. 
</p><p>This opens the <b>expWks</b> X-Function dialog. This dialog is identical to the <b>Export Graph</b> dialog with the addition of an <b>Export Area</b> control.
</p><p>In the dialog, select the type for the exported file from the <b>Image Type</b> drop-down list. 
</p><p>Then expand the <b>Export Settings</b> branch and select <b>Whole</b> with the <b>Export Area</b> drop-down list. (This option also supports exporting only the <b>Visible</b> area of a worksheet or only the area including your <b>Selection</b>.)
</p><p>Note that you can set a desired width for the output, and height is automatically set maintaining aspect ratio. 
</p><p>Groups of cells in the worksheet can be arbitrarily merged for placing graphs, images, report tables, and text, allowing creation of custom report sheets. 
</p><p>This custom report creation ability combined with the ability to arbitrarily set the width of the worksheet export file allows for creation of presentations including large posters.
