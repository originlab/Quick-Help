<h1 class="firstHeading">1.45 FAQ-162 What is the System Theme and how does it affect my graphs?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>System-Theme</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/4/2019</p>
<p>When a system theme is on, the settings from it will be applied to any and all graphs that get created. A graph is first created from a template and then the settings from the system theme are applied, so the use of a system theme is a way to globally change the look of all your graphs.
</p><p><br />
If there is a system theme, you will see the name in the lower right of the status bar. Select <b>Preferences: Theme Organizer</b> to open the dialog. The System Theme will be the one that is bolded. Right-click on any theme and choose <b>Set as System Theme</b> from the context menu. You can only have one system theme on, but you can combine multiple themes to create one new one, and then set that as your system theme.
