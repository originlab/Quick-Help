<h1 class="firstHeading">3.103 FAQ-634 How can I smooth the contour lines in a contour plot?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Smooth-Contour-Lines</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>In order to smooth the lines in a contour plot you need to smooth the data in the matrix it is plotted from. Do this by using the <b>Analysis: Signal Process: Smooth</b> from the Origin menu. This will perform a smoothing routine on your data and the associated contour plot will become smooth with the new values.
