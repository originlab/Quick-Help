<p>Dialog themes provide a way for you to save the settings in the dialog to an external disk file for future use. You can save multiple theme files for a dialog, thus customizing the dialog to be used in different modes with different data. Theme files get saved to the User Files in <b>\Themes\AnalysisAndReportTable</b>.
</p><p>In any dialog that supports Themes, click the triangle button to the right of <b>Dialog Theme</b> to access a fly-out menu of items to manage dialog themes.
</p><p>Depending on the dialog, and whether the dialog is accessible from a menu, custom themes you save from your dialog may appear as additional fly-out items in the main menu. Themes chosen in a submenu execute without opening the dialog unless the Shift key is held down. The theme can also be selected from the <b>Dialog Theme</b> fly-out at the top of the dialog.
</p><p>Settings used last time the dialog was operated, are saved as <b>&lt;last used&gt;</b> theme. Depending on how the dialog is launched from the menu, either the default theme, or the last used theme, or a named theme is loaded when opening the dialog.
</p><p>Dialogs that support theme saving also have an option for saving your settings as the default. Select the <b>Save as &lt;Default&gt;</b> fly-out menu option to save your settings as the new default. You can roll back the default settings to internal/system defaults any time by using the <b>System Default</b> option in the fly-out menu.
