<br /><br />
In fact, Windows will stop the message or data which is being sent from a lower privilege process to a higher privilege process in order to prevent potential attacks. If you run Origin as administrator, it indicates that Origin have a higher privilege than other processes included Windows Explorer, where your data and apps usually come from. Therefore, if you try to drag-and-drop in this situation, it doesn’t work.
<br /><br />
If you want to import data or install App by drag-and-drop easily, do NOT run Origin as administrator. You can just double click on Origin program icon or right click on Origin program icon and select <b>Open</b> to launch Origin.<br />
