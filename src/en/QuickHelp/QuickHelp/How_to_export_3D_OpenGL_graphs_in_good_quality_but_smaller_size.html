<h1 class="firstHeading">1.94 FAQ-447 How to export 3D OpenGL graphs in good quality but smaller file size?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>ExpGraph-high-quality</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/25/2021</p>
<p>When exporting a 3D OpenGL graph with large dataset, one may obtain a good quality graph but with very large size.
</p><p>For this case, one can try to set <a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#O">system variable @oglsv = 0</a> and export again. This will automatically downgrade the quality of exported graph to a reasonable level but greatly reduce the image size. 
</p><p>Alternatively, one can set DPI to a lower level such as 100 in <b>Export Settings: Advanced: Resolution: 100</b> in <b>expGraph</b> dialog.
