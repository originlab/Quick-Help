<p>This problem does not occur in Origin 9.1 or higher version. However, in Origin 9.0 SR0 and SR1, if your hard drive available space is higher than 2TB, you will encounter this issue. In this case, please <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/www/company/qform.aspx?s=1&amp;sbj=reginfo@1" target="_blank">contact OriginLab</a> to obtain the Origin 9.0 SR2 installer.
