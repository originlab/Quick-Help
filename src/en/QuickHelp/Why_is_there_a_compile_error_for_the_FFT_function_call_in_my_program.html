<h1 class="firstHeading">4.38 FAQ-398 Why is there a compile error for the FFT function call in my program?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>FFT-Compile-Error</p>

<p><br />
Sometimes, you compile an Origin C function that calls the FFT function (for example, <a class="external text" href="http://www.originlab.com/ftp/programming/FFTUsingNAG.c" target="_blank">this one in our website</a>) and see the following compile error:
</p>
<dl><dd><code>Error, Function FFT@IAAAAAAAMAAABAAAMAAABAAA was called, but its body could not be located during linking.</code></dd></dl>
<p>This indicates that the body of the FFT function is not found. To solve the problem, please do the following two things:
</p>
<ol><li>Make sure that your program has included the file <b>fft_utils.h</b>, which is located in &lt;Origin Program Folder&gt;\OriginC\System.</li>
<li>Add the file <b>&lt;Origin Program Folder&gt;\OriginC\Originlab\fft_utils.c</b> to the current workspace.</li></ol>
