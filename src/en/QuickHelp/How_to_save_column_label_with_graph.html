<p><br />
You can store a lot of supporting information in an Origin workbook and at least a portion of this data becomes part of any graph that is made from that workbook data. In an effort to reduce file sizes, some workbook information is excluded (e.g <b>F(x)=</b> column label row formulas, user-defined variables saved on data file import, etc.) when saving graphs as OGG files or when doing an <b>Edit: Copy Page</b> (or CTRL+C) and pasting the graph into your office application as an OLE-editable graph object.
</p><p>If you want to save all worksheet information with an OGG file or embedded Origin graph, then you should set the "<a class="external text" href="../../LabTalk/LabTalk/System_Variable_List.html#S"><b>@sow</b></a>" LabTalk system variable to <b>1</b> (default=0 minimizes file size).
</p><p>To save all workbook data in the current Origin session only, open the Script Window (<b>Window: Script Window</b>), type the following, then press Enter:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">@sow<span style="color: #000080;">=</span><span style="color: #0000dd;">1</span></pre>
<p>Subsequently, any graph saved as an OGG or inserted into another application as an OLE object <i>in the current session</i>, will contain all workbook data.
</p><p>To <i>always</i> save all workbook data with the graph, click <b>Preferences: System Variables</b> and in the <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Set_System_Variables_Dialog_Box.html">Set System Variables dialog</a>, set <b>sow</b> to <b>1</b>.
