<h1 class="firstHeading">3.131 FAQ-769 Can I pre-process peak data, such as exclude unwanted data, before each analysis process?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Batch-PA-Script-before-each-Process</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 10/13/2016</p>
<p>Yes, you can run specified scripts before each process to pre-process data before each peak analysis. Refer to <a href="../../Tutorial/Tutorial/Batch_Peak_Analysis_Using_Theme_with_Script_Before_Each_Process.html" title="Tutorial:Batch Peak Analysis Using Theme with Script Before Each Process">this tutorial</a> for the detailed instruction.
</p><p>Note that <b>Batch Peak Analysis Using Theme</b> dialog also provides options to run script after each process and at the end of all processes. Besides, almost all peak analysis settings, including Snap to Spectrum; Relative Baseline; Sequentially Initializing Parameter Values, can be saved in theme to help generate results in batch processing.
