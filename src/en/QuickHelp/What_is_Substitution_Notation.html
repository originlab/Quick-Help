<h1 class="firstHeading">4.26 FAQ-385 What is Substitution Notation?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>SubstitutionNotation</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 3/31/2023</p>
<p>When a script is executed, the LabTalk interpreter searches for two types of special substitution notation which are identified by the initial characters of&#160;% or $. These are then sent to the substitution processor, which replaces the original string with another string.
</p><p>There are four types of run-time substitutions:
</p><p>String register substitution&#160;%A -&#160;%Z, etc.
%( ) Substitution, a powerful notation to resolve&#160;%(str$),&#160;%(range), worksheet info and column dataset names, worksheet cells, legends, etc.
$( ) Substitution, where $(expression) resolves the numeric expression and formats the result as a string.
%n Macro and Script substitutions of the form&#160;%n, where arguments are passed to a macro or a script.
