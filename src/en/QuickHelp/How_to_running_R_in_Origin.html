<p>There are 3 different ways to run R in Origin:
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>R Console</b>, which requests R package installed on local computer. It allows Origin users to issue R commands within the Origin environment. 
<li><b>Rserve Console</b>, which requests R package installed on a server computer. Origin provides this RServe Console to allow remote access to R, it works similarly as R Console.
<li>Use LabTalk Object <b>R</b> and <b>RS</b> to execute R commands and pass variable(s) and dataset(s) between LabTalk and R.
</ul>
