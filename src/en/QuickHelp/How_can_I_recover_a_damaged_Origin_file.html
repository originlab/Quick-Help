<h1 class="firstHeading">2.30 FAQ-464 How can I recover a damaged Origin file?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Recover-Damaged-OPJ</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 10/10/2020</p>
<p>When you save an Origin project file, Origin firsts saves a copy of the file, as it existed when it was <i>last saved</i>, to backup. If you find that your project file has become corrupted, you may be able to recover the previously saved version of the file by opening a backup file:
</p>
<ul><li> In Origin 2018b and later, each project has its own backup file.  These files are stored in the <b>\Backup</b> folder (e.g. at C:\Users\<i>user</i>\Documents\OriginLab\Backup) and named with a name such as MyProject-1234567.opju).</li>
<li> In earlier versions of Origin, there was a single backup file located in your <b>User Files Folder</b> (e.g. at C:\Users\<i>user</i>\Documents\OriginLab\2017\User Files) and named as Backup.OPJ.</li></ul>
<h4><a name="1._Locating_and_Opening_your_Backup_Project_File"></a><span class="mw-headline">1. Locating and Opening your Backup Project File</span></h4>
<ul><li> In Origin 2018b and later, choose <b>Help: Open Folder: Project Backup (Folder)</b> or choose <b>Preference: Options</b>, click on the <b>System Path</b> tab and copy the <b>\Backup</b> path and paste that path to the address bar in Windows File Explorer.</li>
<li> In Origin 2018 and earlier, you'll find a single Backup.OPJ file in the <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_User_Files_Folder.html">User Files Folder</a>. Open <b>Preference: Options</b>, click the <b>System Path</b> tab and copy the <b>User Files Folder</b> path and paste that path to the address bar in Windows File Explorer.</li></ul>
<p><br />
Once you have located the backup file, open it in Origin. If this is the file you seek:
</p>
<ul><li> Origin 2018b and later: Save the file to a new location.</li>
<li> Origin 2018 and earlier: Save the file to a new location with a new name (i.e. something other than "Backup.OPJ").</li></ul>
<h4><a name="2._Recovering_Datasets_from_a_Corrupted_Project"></a><span class="mw-headline">2. Recovering Datasets from a Corrupted Project</span></h4>
<p>If method (1) doesn't work, try the following: Open your corrupted project file, then open the Script Window (<b>Window:Script Window</b>) and type:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">list s</pre>
<p>and press Enter. If the file is not too corrupted, a list of datasets will be returned. The list will look similar to this example:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;"> <span style="color: #0000dd;">1</span>	MyData_Time
 <span style="color: #0000dd;">2</span><span style="color: #000080;">*</span>	MyData_Sample1
 <span style="color: #0000dd;">3</span><span style="color: #000080;">*</span>	MyData_Sample2
 <span style="color: #0000dd;">4</span>	Data2_A
 <span style="color: #0000dd;">5</span><span style="color: #000080;">*</span>	Data2_B
 <span style="color: #0000dd;">6</span><span style="color: #000080;">*</span>	Data2_C</pre>
<p>Which lists two different worksheets&#160;: <b>MyData</b> and <b>Data2</b>. To recover these datasets, use the Edit command to recreate all worksheets one by one. For example, run:
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">Edit MyData_Sample1;</pre> 
<p>and press Enter. This will bring up the "MyData" worksheet including all three associated datasets. 
</p><p>After Origin 2021, you can use following command to recreate all worksheets at one run:  
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">run <span style="color: #000080;">-</span>oc EditAllSeries;</pre>
<p>Unfortunately graph windows cannot be recovered.
</p><p>After "editing" each worksheet copy/paste the data from the first instance of Origin (the corrupted file) to a second instance of Origin (a non-corrupted file). Alternatively, you can export the worksheet data in the corrupted file (select <b>File: Export ASCII</b> from the main menu) and then import the ASCII data into a new Origin project file.
