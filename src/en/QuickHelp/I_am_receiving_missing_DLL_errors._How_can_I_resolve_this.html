<p>Origin is built using Microsoft (MS) Visual C++, and thus it requires certain MS DLLs to run. These DLLs need to exist on the computer where Origin runs. You may see an MS DLL error at Origin startup on a computer without these DLLs, especially if you use MSI to install Origin.
</p><p>To fix this problem, follow steps on <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/What_should_I_do_if_my_Origin_crashes.html#Step_3:_Modify_DLLs" title="QuickHelp:What should I do if my Origin crashes">this FAQ</a> to reinstall required DLLs.
