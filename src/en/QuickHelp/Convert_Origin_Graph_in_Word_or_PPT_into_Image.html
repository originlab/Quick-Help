<h1 class="firstHeading">5.32 FAQ-725 Convert Origin Graph in Word or PPT into Image</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Word_PPT_Image</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 7/31/2018</p>
<p>Copy-and-pasting Origin graph as an OLE object (CTRL-J in Origin, then CTRL-V in Word/PPT) allows you to double-click the image and launch Origin to make changes to the graph. When multiple graphs are pasted in this manner, the Word/PowerPoint file size may become large because the graph image and data are both stored in the destination file.
</p><p>Once the graphs are finalized, you may want to convert the OLE object to just an image, to reduce the size of your Word/PPT file. To convert the objects, follow these simple steps:
</p>
<ol><li> Click on the desired graph image in Word/PPT</li>
<li> Press CTRL + C, then right-click and select <b>Edit: Paste Special</b></li>
<li> Paste as a Picture (Enhanced Metafile)</li>
<li> Remove the original object</li></ol>
