<h1 class="firstHeading">6.20 FAQ-22 How can I find out if a service release is available for my Origin?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Check-Available-Patch</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/30/2023</p>
<p>Within a version, OriginLab typically releases one or more service releases to fix problems found in the release version. The service release is provided as a patch. Typically a new installer based on that service release is also available.
</p><p><b>Important</b>: To run the patch, you must have run Origin once, such as during the license process or after Origin is licensed.
</p><p><span class='headerInParagraph'>Two ways to obtain a Service Release</span>
</p>
<ul><li> Get Help Files/Check for Updates</li></ul>
<dl><dd>If your Origin is registered, you can run <b>Help: Get Help Files/Check for Updates</b> to check if there is patch available for your Origin version and build. If a patch is available, it will display in the <b>Check for Updates</b> dialog box, and you can select to download the patch. At the end of the patch download process, you will be asked if you want to close Origin to run patch, or run the patch later. Information is provided on how to run the patch at a later time.</dd></dl>
<ul><li>Download the Patch from OriginLab Website</li></ul>
<dl><dd>OriginLab also provides patches for download from the <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Support&amp;pid=1036" target="_blank">Support area</a> of the OriginLab website. Before checking if a patch is available, run Origin and select <b>Help:About Origin</b>. Make note of the version and full build number in the <b>About Origin</b> dialog box. The patch download page on the OriginLab website provides instructions on saving and applying the patch. A link is also provided to review the patch Release Notes.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Note</b>: If you have a multi-seats package and want to deploy a Service Release, please refer to <a class="external text" href="../../License/License/Multi_userDeployment.html#Types_of_Files_that_can_be_Published">this page</a>.
