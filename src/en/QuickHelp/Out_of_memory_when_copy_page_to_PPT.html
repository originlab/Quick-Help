<h1 class="firstHeading">1.192 FAQ-893 I see an "Out of Memory" error message when I copy page to PowerPoint? What is wrong?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>OutOfMemory-CopyToPPT</p>

<p>When you copy a graph and paste to PowerPoint as an OLE object, you might get an error message:<br />
"<i>There isn't enough memory to perform the operation.</i>"
</p><p>Actually, when you copy page from a graph and paste it as an Origin Graph Object into PowerPoint, the generated EMF file(saved within the PPT file) might be larger than 23M. Then, this error will occur. 
</p><p>But, this issue is none of Origin's business, it is <a class="external text" href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msoffice/forum/msoffice_powerpoint-mso_winother/there-isnt-enough-memory-to-perform-this-operation/e7113cfb-cc6b-4714-b0dc-4c1e48f2a32d" target="_blank">a validated problem in PowerPoint</a>. 
</p><p>To avoid this problem, you can 
</p>
<ul><li> Use menu <b>Edit: Copy Graph as Image</b> instead to copy and paste the page as a picture.</li></ul>
<p>or 
</p>
<ul><li> Use menu <b>Edit:Copy Page</b> but paste it as a picture in PowerPoint.</li></ul>
