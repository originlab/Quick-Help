<p>Sometimes one may encounter the situation that double clicking on the embedded Origin graph in Word/PowerPoint failed to open it in Origin. To solve this, right click on Origin program icon and choose <b>Run as administrator</b> to fix registry. 
</p><p>If the above solution cannot fix the problem, please try the following to check if the <b>Run this program as an administrator</b> checkbox is checked by mistake:
</p>
<ol><li>Go to Origin program folder, find the Origin.exe file. Right-click on it to select <b>Properties...</b> from the context menu.</li>
<li>In the <b>Properties</b> dialog, go to <b>Compatibility</b> tab. UNCHECK <b>Run this program as an administrator</b> checkbox. Click <b>OK</b> button.</li>
<li>Right-click Origin icon to select <b>Run as Administrator</b> to open launch Origin.</li>
<li>Try to copy and paste the graph to Word again.</li></ol>
