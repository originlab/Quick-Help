<p>The Command Window is used to interactively run LabTalk scripts and X-Functions, and is opened from the <b>Window: Command Window</b> menu. It is comprised of two panels: History Panel and Command Panel. The History Panel (on the left), conveniently stores the history of previously issued commands. (This is stored in a text file, LTHistory.txt, in your User Files Folder.) The Command Panel (on the right) includes <b>Auto Complete</b> for easy use of X-Functions:
</p>
<ul><li> Type <b>st</b> in the Command Panel - Auto Complete shows two X-Functions</li>
<li> Select <b>stats</b> and press Enter</li>
<li> Press <b>space</b> key - Auto Complete shows next available arguments</li></ul>
<p>Right-click inside the Command Panel of Command Window and choose <b>Preference...</b> from the context menu. You can then set preference settings for <i><b>Auto Complete</b></i>, <i><b>Prompt</b></i> and <i><b>Command History</b></i>.
