When using the <b>NLFit</b> tool or the <b>Fitting Function Organizer</b> tool, you can see the sample curve and the equation of the built-in function in the lower pane of the tool. These images are very informative for that they can tell us the general shapes of the fitting curves. 
</p><p>To supply your own equation and sample curve images for your fitting function, you can simply put an <b>.svg</b>, <b>.emf</b> or <b>.wmf</b> file (for the Equation) and <b>_cuv.svg</b>, <b>_cuv.emf</b>, <b>_cuv.wmf</b> or <b>.cuv</b> (wmf format) file (for the Sample Curve) with the same name as the .fdf  file(the definition file of your own fitting function) under <b>&lt;UFF&gt;\FitFunc</b> folder, where &lt;uff&gt; refers to your user files folder. 
</p><p>To create a .wmf (Equation) file, you can use <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/fileExchange/details.aspx?fid=221" target="_blank"><b>LaTeX</b> App</a> to write down the function expression in an Origin Graph/Layout page, and then export it as a .wmf file (<b>File: Export Graph</b>).
</p><p>To create a .cuv (Sample Curve) file, you can create a typical sample curve in Origin and then export it as a .wmf file and rename it as a .cuv file.
