<p>This could be a problem with the User Files folder setting. If your <b>User Files Folder</b> has been set to a network path or a <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/Windows_Freeze_Crash_when_Origin_Starts_or_is_Running.html" title="QuickHelp:Windows Freeze Crash when Origin Starts or is Running">cloud-syncing service</a>, please delete the User Files folder (if needed, backup any customized files before deleting). Then try to start Origin again. You will be asked for a new <b>User Files Folder</b>. Please choose a folder on the local computer this time. 
</p><p>If the above solution doesn't work, please contact <a class="external text" href="http://www.originlab.com/index.aspx?go=SUPPORT" target="_blank">OriginLab Technical Support</a> so we can help check this.
