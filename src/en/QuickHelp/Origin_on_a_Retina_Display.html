<h1 class="firstHeading">5.9 FAQ-346 How do I solve Origin display problem in high resolution screen?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Mac-Retina-Display-of-Origin</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 4/7/2022</p>
<p>More and more displays are capable of much higher screen resolutions than is typical monitors (up to 227 ppi vs 96 ppi). While Origin is functional at the native resolution, testing has shown that using a resolution of <strong>1920 X 1200</strong>, with <strong>Medium</strong> system text scaling (125%) offers the best user experience when running Origin.
</p><p>If the display has a higher screen resolution, for example a QHD display with resolution of 3200 X 1800, you may find buttons and text on menu or dialog are extremely small inside Origin. To solve the problem, please try the following solutions.
