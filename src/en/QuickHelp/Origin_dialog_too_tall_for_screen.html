<h1 class="firstHeading">5.68 FAQ-955 What do I do when a dialog is too tall for my screen?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Origin-dialog-too-tall-for-screen</p>-
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 3/6/2019</p>
<p>On some computers with lower resolution (e.g. 1920 X 1080), you may find a dialog box is too tall or too big to show the whole dialog page in one monitor. 
</p><p><span class='headerInParagraph'> Plot Details dialog </span>
</p>
<dl><dd>If the dialog is too tall to click the buttons at the bottom, which often happens to the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog, <font color="red">please upgrade your Origin to <b>version 2019</b> or later</font>. <br /></dd>
<dd>We improved the dialog size in Origin 2019. Right now, the dialog will auto resize to fit the active tab's smallest possible size. If the active tab is too large, you can switch to another tab with fewer options, like <b>Drop Lines</b> tab. The dialog is auto "shrunk" so you can click “OK” or “Apply”.</dd></dl>
<p><span class='headerInParagraph'>Expandable dialog such as "Plot Setup"</span>
</p>
<dl><dd>If the dialog has multiple panels and expanding all panels makes the dialog too big, like <b>Nonlinear Curve Fit</b> dialog and <b>Plot Setup</b> dialog, please collapse one or two panels so you can reach the bottom buttons or drag to resize the dialog.<br /></dd>
