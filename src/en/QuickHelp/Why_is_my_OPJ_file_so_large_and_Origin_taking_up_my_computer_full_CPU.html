<p>If you are experiencing any of these problems:
</p>
<ul><li>When you are working with a specific Origin project file (OPJ), Origin occupies the computer's full CPU.</li>
<li>The size of an OPJ is unreasonably large.</li>
<li>When you click the yellow Recalculate toolbar button, recalculation fails and the button turns red.</li></ul>
<p>These problems may be caused by pending operations. To solve this problem, perform the steps below to delete the pending operations.
</p><p>Open the specific OPJ, then open the <b>Script Window</b> (<b>Window:Script Window</b>), type in the following script, and then press <b>ENTER</b>. Origin will list the operations in the <b>Script Window</b>. (Pending operations are operations without input and output)
</p>
