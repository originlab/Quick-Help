If <b>Origin Central</b> or <b>App Center</b> fail to open; or a window opens entitled "Script Error" (see below) when you use an Origin feature or App, it is most likely caused by the Windows System file "mshtml.dll" being out-of-date or missing. This is typically only the case with older versions of Windows and is due to not keeping up with Windows Updates in a timely manner.

<p>If an Origin App is causing the above window to open (indicating a Javascript error), first check to see if <b>Origin Central</b> will open (press <b>F11</b> on your keyboard). If it opens, then the issue is not with "mshtml.dll"- it is most likely an issue with the App itself and the error should be reported to <a class="external text" href="http://originlab.com/index.aspx?go=Support/DocumentationAndHelpCenter" target="_blank">OriginLab Tech Support</a>.
</p><p>However, if Origin Central fails to open then "mshtml.dll" must be updated. One of the simplest methods to update "mshtml.dll" is to install the latest version of <b>Internet Explorer</b> applicable to your Windows version. Though Origin does <b>not</b> need Internet Explorer itself, it does need "mshtml.dll" and installing Internet Explorer will update that file.
