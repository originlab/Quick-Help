<h1 class="firstHeading">6.104 FAQ-1160 What should I do if I see a "tcp_s is bad" error when I start server?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Tcp-s-Is-Bad</p>

<p>If Origin license server cannot start and you see following error in the debug log:
</p><p><code>tcp_s is bad!!! Exiting</code>
</p><p>It is caused by that you have specified a port number for the vendor daemon <b>orglab</b> in the license file but that port is already used by another process. 
</p><p><span class='headerInParagraph'>To solve this problem,</span>
</p><p>If Origin is not on the other side of the firewall, there is no need to specify a port number for <b>orglab</b>. Otherwise, ensure you use a free, unoccupied port. Refer to <a class="external text" href="../../License/Category/Concurrent_Additional_Information(License).html#Allowing_Access_through_a_Firewall">this page</a> for more information of how to allow Origin access through a firewall.
