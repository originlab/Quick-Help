<h1 class="firstHeading">5.33 FAQ-727 How to make a multi-page PDF file from multiple graph windows</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Multi-Page-PDF</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 8/9/2018</p>
<p>Origin doesn't have direct way to save multiple graph windows as a multi-page PDF file. But you can first use Origin's <a class="external text" href="http://www.originlab.com/doc/User-Guide/Publishing-and-Export#Sending_Graphs_to_PowerPoint" target="_blank"><b>Sending Graphs to PowerPoint</b></a> to send graphs to PowerPoint. Then, choose <b>Save as PDF Format</b> option in PowerPoint to create a multi-page PDF file.
</p><p>Note:
</p>
<ol><li> <b>Send Graphs to PowerPoint</b> will send all graphs in a folder to PowerPoint. If you want to skip some graph windows, you can select <b>Specified</b> from the <b>Select Graph(s)</b> drop-down list and specify in the <b>Graph Page</b> edit box the graphs you want to send. Or, you can right-click the graphs you want to skip in Project Explorer and choose <b>Skip Slide</b>.</li>
<li> If graphs are not in the same folder in Origin, you can select <b>Specified</b> from the <b>Select Graph(s)</b> drop-down list and click the browse button next to <b>Graph Page</b> edit box to add graphs in different folders using <b>Graph Browser</b> dialog. Or, you can right-click each graph window, and create shortcuts to them in <b>Favorites</b> folder. Then go to <b>Favorites</b> folder to send graphs to PowerPoint.</li>
<li> If you select <b>Specified</b> for <b>Select Graph(s)</b>, the slide order follows the graph order in the <b>Graph Page</b> edit box. If you select other items for <b>Select Graph(s)</b>, to adjust slide order, in the Details view of Project Explorer, first click Slide column header to sort windows by slide. Then, drag graph windows up or down to adjust the the slide order.</li>
<li> To include a layout window in the slides, send them as Pictures rather than embedded Origin objects.</li></ol>
