<p>When you copy an image object and paste it from one layout/graph to another, the image size will change if page size is different. 
</p><p>To preserve the size of the image object, copy the image object, then hold down <b>Alt</b> key and right-click on the destination layout or graph, and click <b>Paste</b>. The Image object will be preserved in its original size. Please note that this only applies to Image objects: EMFs, old bitmap objects, DIBs, new image graphical objects, and SVG objects.
