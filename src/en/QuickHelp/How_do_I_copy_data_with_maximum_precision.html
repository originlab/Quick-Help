<h1 class="firstHeading">2.46 FAQ-482 How do I copy data with maximum precision?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Copy-with-Full-Precision</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 10/21/2021</p>
<p>A numerical value in an Origin worksheet or matrixsheet is stored internally as a 64-bit "double precision" binary number.  In the Origin interface, this binary number is represented as a decimal number that can be expressed with approximately 15 fractional digits with a maximum exponent of +/- 308.
</p><p>Worksheets and matrixsheets are <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_(Column_Properties)_Properties_Tab.html#Digits">typically formatted to display only 5 or 6 decimal digits</a> but the user should be aware that the displayed number may be a shortened representation of the "Full Precision" (max 15 digit) number that Origin stores in the cell.

<ol><li> <b>Edit: Copy: Copy</b> or <b>Ctrl+C</b> copies data with full precision in the following cases:
<ul><li> Copy data from one worksheet, including result sheet, to another worksheet in same or different Origin sessions. <b>Note:</b> This does not apply to the matrixsheet.</li>
<li> Copy data from external application e.g. MS Excel into Origin worksheet.</li></ul></li>
<li> All other cases, <b>Edit: Copy: Copy</b> or <b>Ctrl+C</b> copies data with displayed precision only. To Copy data with full precision, please choose <b>Edit: Copy: Copy (Full Precision)</b> or <b>Ctrl+Alt+C</b>.</li>
<li> If a worksheet cell is actually a <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Inserting_Links_into_Worksheet_Cells.html#Links_to_Show_Contents_From_Other_Cell">link to other worksheet cell</a>, for instance an output report sheet with values linked to fitting results:
<ul><li> When copying and pasting from one worksheet to another worksheet in same Origin session, <b>Edit: Copy: Copy (Ctrl+C)</b> and <b>Edit: Copy: Copy (Full Precision) (Ctrl+Alt+C)</b> work the same. The link is pasted. If the source data are subsequently changed, the linked cell will update.</li>
<li> When copying from one Origin session and pasting to a new Origin session, you must use <b>Edit: Copy: Copy (Full Precision)</b> or <b>Ctrl+ALT+C</b>. Otherwise, it will only copy the link and display it as text, such as <i>FitLinear1!Summary.R1.Intercept_Error</i> and this cannot be interpreted in the new Origin session. Copying linked cell value between sessions is newly supported since Origin 2018. </li>
<li> When copying in Origin and pasting to external applications, use <b>Edit: Copy: Copy (Full Precision)</b> or <b>Ctrl+ALT+C</b> to copy full precision. Otherwise it will only copy the displayed precision.</li></ul></li></ol>

<h4><a name="A_Note_About_Copy_.28Full_Precision.29_in_Origin"></a><span class="mw-headline">A Note About Copy (Full Precision) in Origin</span></h4>
<p>When using <b>Copy (Full Precision)</b> to copy data from Origin to an external application such as MS Excel, Origin always converts the internal binary number to a decimal number of maximum of 15 significant digits. 
</p><p>Prior to Origin 2018, <b>Copy (full precision)</b>, like <b>Copy</b>, would have used Origin's internal binary value when copying and pasting from one worksheet to another worksheet in Origin. Beginning with Origin 2018, <b>Copy (full precision)</b> will <i>always</i> converts number first as well. 
</p><p>This change was made to accommodate those who wanted to copy data which is actually a link to other cells(values in a customized report sheet which actually are linked to parameter values in fitting result sheet) to a worksheet in new Origin session. Prior to Origin 2018, no matter you use <b>Copy</b> or <b>Copy (Full Precision)</b>, the link will be pasted. Since the link couldn't be interpreted in new Origin session, it will be displayed as a meaningless text e.g.<i>FitLinear1!Summary.R1.Intercept_Error</i> . In Origin 2018, <b>Copy (Full Precision)</b> will first convert the linked data into decimal number of maximum of 15 significant digits and then paste so it will show as values. 
</p><p>If you will not do the above copy and paste among different Origin sessions and would prefer to have <b>Copy (full precision)</b> work inside Origin as it did prior to Origin 2018, open the <b>Script Window</b>, type the following, then press Enter: 
</p>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">@CFP<span style="color: #000080;">=</span><span style="color: #0000dd;">0</span></pre>
<p>This changes the behavior within the current Origin session only. To have this behavior take effect every time you start Origin, see <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/How_do_I_permanently_change_the_value_of_a_system_variable.html" title="QuickHelp:How do I permanently change the value of a system variable">this FAQ</a>.
