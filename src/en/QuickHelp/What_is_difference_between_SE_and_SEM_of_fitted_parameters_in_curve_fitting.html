<p>In regression calculation, <b>SE</b> (Standard Error) of the fitted parameter is the same as <b>SD</b> (Standard Deviation). Refer to <a href="../../QuickHelp/QuickHelp/What_is_difference_between_SE_and_SD_of_fitted_parameters_in_curve_fitting.html" title="QuickHelp:What is difference between SE and SD of fitted parameters in curve fitting">this FAQ</a> for details. However, <b>SEM</b> (Standard Error Mean) is not used in regression. It is mainly used in statistics comparing a group of data. 
</p><p>In statistics, <b>SD</b> represents the dispersion of a group of data, while <b>SEM</b> is "the standard deviation of the mean" calculated by the following equation.

</p><p>It provides information to determine how well the mean is if you repeat the measure many times. Generally speaking, <b>SD</b> and <b>SEM</b> are very different.
