<h1 class="firstHeading">3.20 FAQ-245 Why are fitted parameters different when fitting data are transformed?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>EffectOfRSS</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>When we transform fitting data and use the transformed fitting function to fit, sometimes we may find fitted parameters are different, although it seems like both fit data well. 
</p><p>For example, for fitting function y=a/(x-b), we transform y to 1/y, and the fitting function becomes linear, v=c*x-d
</p><p>where v=1/y, a=1/c and b=d/c .
</p><p>a and b calculated from two fitted results may be different. This is due to different contributions to <b>residual sum of squares</b> (<b>RSS</b>) for points in two models. For the function y=a/(x-b), y is large at small x and small at large x, so points at small x contribute more to <b>RSS</b>, and points at large x contribute less to <b>RSS</b>. And for the function v=c*x-d, v is large at large x and small at small x, so the contribution to <b>RSS</b> is reverse.
</p><p>This may also occur for other transforms, e.g. y=a*exp(-b*x) is transformed to log(y)=log(a)-log(e)*b*x, <img src="../images/Why_are_fitted_parameters_different_when_fitting_data_are_transformed/math-ff80fe0711c6db8cee67be0dfc0f6b1b.png?v=0" title="y=ax^b\!" alt="y=ax^b\!" class="tex"/> is transformed to log(y)=log(a)+b*log(x) .
