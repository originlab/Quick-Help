<p>Origin allows you to define an ordinary differential equation (ODE) by calling NAG functions. See the tutorial <a href="../../Tutorial/Tutorial/Fitting_with_an_Ordinary_Differential_Equation.html" title="Tutorial:Fitting with an Ordinary Differential Equation">Fitting with an Ordinary Differential Equation</a>, which shows how to fit a first-order ordinary differential equation using the Runge Kutta method. A higher order ODE or ODE system can also be defined in a similar way.
