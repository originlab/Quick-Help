<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 7/3/2018</p>
<p>This issue started since Windows Vista and on and not unique to Origin. Usually the message is <b>There is a problem sending the command to the program</b>. It only happens on some PCs and we don't have a fix for this yet. Try the following suggestions and see if one of them will help.
</p>
<h2><a name="Suggestion_1"></a><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion 1</span></h2>
<p>Specify the default application to use when open the opj file again
</p>
<ol><li> Right-click the Origin EXE and choose <b>Run as administrator</b> to run Origin once and exit.</li>
<li> Right click on an OPJ file and select <b>Open With:Choose Programs</b>. </li>
<li>Choose the Origin shortcut and check "Always use the selected program for this file". </li>
<li> We started to support 64 bit Origin in 9.0. If your OS is 64 bit, and installed both 32 and 64 bits Origin. Some user said if the default Program to open OPJ is Origin<i>##</i>_64.exe, change it to Origin<i>##</i>.exe or vice versa fixed it.</li></ol>
<h2><a name="Suggestion_2"></a><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion 2</span></h2>
<p>Clear DDE settings in Registry
</p>
<ol><li>Run origin as administrator, select <b>Window:Script Window</b> to open the Script window.</li>
<li> run the script "<b>doc -ddde 1</b>". Here <b>ddde</b> stand for disable DDE</li>
<li> Following the popup message  to close origin and run Origin once as administrator. Close Origin.</li></ol>
<h2><a name="Suggestion_3"></a><span class="mw-headline">Suggestion 3</span></h2>
<p>Make Sure Compatiblity Settings of the Origin exe file was not changed.
</p>
<ol><li> Exit Origin and find the Origin EXE file in Windows Explorer. </li>
<li> Right click the Origin exe file and choose <b>Properties</b> context menu. </li>
<li> On the <b>Compatibility</b> tab, make sure all boxes in this tab are UNCHECKED and click OK.</li>
<li>Right-click the Origin EXE and choose <b>Run as administrator</b> to run Origin once.</li></ol>
<p>Again for Origin 9.0 and higher versions, if your OS is 64 bit and you chose to install both 32 bit and 64 bit.do this for both exe files (Origin<i>##</i>.exe and Origin<i>##</i>_64.exe).
</p><p><br />
</p><p><br />
If you have two versions of Origin on the same PC, e.g. both Origin 9.0 and Origin 7.5 (Windows Vista, 7, 8, 8.1 or 10). If double clicking opj launches Origin 7.5 instead of Origin 9.0, you can try the following:
</p>
<ol><li>Exit both Origin 7.5 and Origin 9.0.</li>
<li>Find the Origin 9.0 EXE file in Origin Programming Folder.</li>
<li>Right click on the EXE file and choose <b>Run as administrator</b>. </li></ol>
