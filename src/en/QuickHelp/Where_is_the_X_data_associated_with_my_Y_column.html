<h1 class="firstHeading">2.49 FAQ-485 Where is the X data associated with my Y column?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>AssociatedX-with-YCol</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 8/6/2015</p>
<p>Certain custom import operations as well as certain analysis operations may add Y columns to the workbook without specifically adding an associated X column to the left of the Y column.
</p><p>In such circumstances, the X data is uniformly spaced, and the information on the starting X value and step X value are stored in the <b><a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Sampling_interval.html">Sampling Interval</a></b> header row of the associated Y column. Origin uses this sampling interval information in subsequent operations such as graphing and analysis which involve such Y columns. This method reduces the number of columns in the worksheet thus allowing for more efficient storage and presentation of your data.
</p><p>If the Sampling Interval row is not visible, you can turn it on either by right-clicking on the workbook title bar and selecting the <b>View: Sampling Interval</b> context menu, or by opening the <b>Worksheet Properties</b> dialog using the <b>Format: Worksheet</b> menu item and then pressing the <b>Edit Column Label Rows...</b> button to customize what rows to display.
</p><p>When the sampling interval information exists for a Y column, this is indicated by an icon with the letter <b>i</b> on the top left of the Y column header. Clicking on that icon opens the <b>Column additional information</b> dialog which displays the X start and step values as well as other meta data that may be associated with that column. 
</p><p>You can use the <b>Column: Show X Column</b> menu item when such a Y column is selected, and this will create a new X column to the immediate left of the selected Y column. The sampling interval information in the Y column will still continue to exist.
