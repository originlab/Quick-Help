<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>When the intensity is a linear combination of individual components, you can apply curve fitting to process peak decomposition. Origin offers two tools as for fitting multiple peaks, of which some may be overlapping peaks.
</p>
<ul><li>If there is no baseline involved, then the <b>Multiple Peak Fit</b> tool can be used. This tool is accessible from the <b>Analysis:Peaks and Baseline</b> menu. It allows you to click and specify where the peaks should be, and perform the peak fitting based on the specified peak centers. This tool also has an option to open Origin's <b>NLFit</b> dialog box for advanced fitting control.</li></ul>

<ul><li>If there <i>is</i> a baseline involved, the <b>Peak Analyzer</b> tool can be used. Open this tool by clicking <b>Analysis:Peaks and Baseline</b>. Set your <b>Goal</b> to <b>Fit Peaks (Pro)</b> (available in OriginPro). This tool offers multiple methods for baseline and peak detection, with full control of the fitting process. To fit a different peak function for each peak, click the <b>Fit Control</b> button at the bottom of the last page of the wizard.</li></ul>
