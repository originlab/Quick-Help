Some anti-virus software, such as WebRoot, may block the copy-paste of text from the clipboard. This can prevent the user from being able to paste text into Origin dialogs, including the license text for activation. This happens when the Origin software is on the "Deny" list.
</p><p>If you encounter a problem where you are prevented from pasting text into Origin dialogs, but can paste the same information into other programs, such as Notepad, check the settings in your anti-virus software and make sure that Origin is on the "Allow" list.
