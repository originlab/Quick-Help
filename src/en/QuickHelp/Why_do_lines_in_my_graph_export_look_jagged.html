<h1 class="firstHeading">1.182 FAQ-869 Why do lines in my graph export look jagged?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>why-line-jagged</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/4/2019</p>
<p>Origin supports anti-aliasing features which make the lines in your graph smoother. However, in some cases, the anti-aliasing turns off during export.

<ul><li>If you export a 2D graph to a raster image type (JPG, PNG, PCX, BMP, PSD, GIF, TIFF, etc.)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>The anti-aliasing status (on/off) of the exported graph is determined by whether you turn on anti-aliasing for the lines in the graph. For example, if you export a 2D graph to .TIFF image type and want the lines in it look smooth, enable anti-aliasing for the 2D graph in Origin (click the <b>Enable/Disable Anti-Aliasing</b> button <a  class="image"><img alt="Button Enable Anti-Aliasing.png" src="../images/Why_do_lines_in_my_graph_export_look_jagged/Button_Enable_Anti-Aliasing.png?v=24275" width="24"  /></a>) and then export it.</dd></dl>
<ul><li>If you export a 2D graph to a vector image type (WMF, EMF, DXF, EPS, etc.)</li></ul>
<dl><dd>You will find that the quality of the exported graph are good enough even if anti-aliasing turns off. When anti-aliasing turns on, on the other hand, the image quality improves little but the size increases dramatically. So we turn off anti-aliasing when export vector types no matter you turn on it for the graph or not.</dd></dl>

<p>The anti-aliasing always turn on no matter you export the 3D graph to a raster or vector image type.
