<p>Each user of a machine, upon running Origin for the first time, will be prompted to specify a path (<a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/The_User_Files_Folder.html">User Files folder</a>) which will then become the default location for that Origin user. Preferences as well as user custom files such as themes, templates and project files will be saved in this location. The location must have Read &amp; Write privileges for the user.

<p>If you choose a removable drive, then the drive must be available the entire time Origin is in use. If you choose a network drive, network performance will influence Origin performance.
