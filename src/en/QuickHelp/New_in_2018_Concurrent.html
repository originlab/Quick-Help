<h1 class="firstHeading">6.66 FAQ-904 What are the changes for network license for version 2018?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>New-in-2018-Concurrent</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 11/12/2017</p>
<p>We will use the maintenance date to check if you are qualified for the new version, so you can apply the new license easily. If an end machine has Origin 2017 installed and connected to server before, Origin 2018 on the same machine will use the server information of 2017 to check out a license, without manually enter the server info. Otherwise there are no changes to distribution/installation etc.
