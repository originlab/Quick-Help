<p>If you try to activate Origin (no matter online or offline way), after paste the license text into <b>Enter License</b> dialog, you get following error message:
</p><p><font color="red">Licensing Problem: The activation period for this license has expired. Please retrieve a license again, and enter it into the Origin license dialog before the activation period expires.</font>
</p><p>The problem may happen in Origin 2016 and earlier versions.
</p><p><span class='headerInParagraph'>To fix this problem,</span>
</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you enter the license text within the activation period, that is, online way 15 minutes and offline 24 hours.
<li>If you do enter back the license within the activation period but still see this problem, please try following:
<ol>
<li> Close Origin if it is still running.
<li> Open Windows Explorer or My Computer
<li> Browse to: <code>C:\ProgramData\OriginLab\##\</code> (<i>##</i> is your Origin version number)
<li> Delete the entire folder
<li> Right-click on Origin program icon and Run as Administrator
<li> Use the <b>Getting Started</b> license dialog to obtain the license again, and paste the license from the website back into the Enter license dialog. 
</ol>
</ul>
