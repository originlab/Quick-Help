<p>When you have two or more line plots in one graph layer, you could fill the area between them with a pattern.
</p><p>To do this, double click on the data plot to open the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog, go to the <b>Line</b> tab and check <b>Fill Area Under Curve</b>. Then from the drop-down menu, choose <b>Fill to next data plot - One Color</b> or <b>Fill to next data plot - Above Below Colors</b>. When either option is selected, you can further specify how to fill the areas between two data plots in <b>Fill to</b> control group. By default, <b>Common X Area</b> option is selected so that only the areas shared common X range will be filled. You can check <b>Area Enclosed by End Points</b> radio box to fill the areas enclosed by the end points of two plots.
</p><p><b>Note:</b> If you chose the <b>One Color</b> option, the area between the two plots will be filled with the same pattern. If you choose the <b>Above Below Colors</b> option, the fill pattern will differ between the regions where curve A is higher than curve B and that where curve B is higher than curve A.
