<h1 class="firstHeading">4.64 FAQ-1004 What Can I Do When Origin Cannot Connect to R?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Origin-cannot-connect-to-R</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 5/6/2019</p>
<p>If you have <b>R</b> installed on your system but Origin reports that <b>R</b> is not installed or that it cannot find <b>R</b>, there is a simple fix to remedy the issue.
</p>
<h2><a name="Background"></a><span class="mw-headline">Background</span></h2>
<p>When Origin is asked to launch <b>R</b>, it first searches the <b>Windows Registry</b> for the <b>Registry Key</b> for <b>R'</b>s installation folder. If it does not locate that key, it will look for the <code>R_HOME</code> <b>Windows environmental variable</b>.
</p><p>In some cases, <b>R</b> installers for Windows may not set the registry key or the user may skip setting the key. Additionally, the <b>R</b> installer may not set the <code>R_HOME</code> Windows <b>environmental variable</b>.
</p><p>In this situation, Origin will not be able to find <b>R</b> and will assume it is not installed.
</p>
<h2><a name="Solution"></a><span class="mw-headline">Solution</span></h2>
<p>The solution is to add a Windows environmental variable named <b>R_HOME</b> that points to <b>R'</b>s installation folder.
</p><p>Assuming <b>R</b> has been installed into a folder on disk similar to: <code>C:\Program Files\R\R-3.6.0</code>, follow these steps:
</p>
<ol><li> Exit Origin if it is running.</li>
<li> In <b>Windows Search</b>, search for <i>"advanced system settings"</i> (without quotes) and open <b>View advanced system settings (Control Panel)</b>.</li>
<li> In the <b>System Properties</b> dialog, select the <b>Advanced</b> tab.</li>
<li> Click the <b>Environmental Variables...</b> button.</li>
<li> Under either <b>User variables for...</b> or <b>System Variables</b>, click the <b>New...</b> button. <i>(See Note below.)</i></li>
<li> For <b>variable name</b> enter <code>R_HOME</code>.</li>
<li> For <b>variable value</b>, enter the installation path for R on your system (e.g. <code>C:\Program Files\R\R-3.6.0</code>).</li>
<li> Click <b>OK</b> to to close dialogs.</li></ol>
<p><br />
The next time you launch Origin and try connect to <b>R</b>, the connection should be successful.
</p><p><br />
<b>Note</b>: Whether you add the environmental variable to your User variables or the System variables depends on your needs. If it will only be you using <b>R</b> on your computer, setting a User variable may suffice. If others use your PC, you may need to set it as System. You may have to experiment.
