<h1 class="firstHeading">3.141 FAQ-855 Why does my DLL for fitting work in one PC but fail in another?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>fittingDLL-fail-in-anotherPC</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 7/29/2018</p>
<p>If you build a DLL for fitting in a higher version Visual Studio (e.g. VS2015, Property dialog's Configuration Properties: General: Platform Toolset), it may not work in another PC if it doesn't have this version's MS VC Redistributable installed.
</p><p>Note that Origin 2016/2017 and latter version will install MS VC 2012 Redistributable automatically.
