<h3><a name="Computer_ID"></a><span class="mw-headline">Computer ID</span></h3>
<p>The Computer ID is a 16 character, alphanumeric code based on your computer's network device and other attributes of the computer. The Computer ID is generated by Origin to identify your computer for licensing purposes only. 
</p><p>Most users will not need to know their Computer ID since it is generated and handled internally by the Origin software. In rare instances, you may need to know what the ID is (e.g. you are filling out a System Transfer Request form and cannot use Origin's built-in Deactivate License tool). 
</p><p>To get your computer ID:
</p>
<ol><li> Run Origin.</li>
<li> Open the Script Window (<b>Window: Script Window</b>).</li>
<li> Type the following command and press <b>Enter</b>: </li></ol>
<pre class="lt" style="font-family:monospace;">help <span style="color: #000080;">-</span>c</pre>
<p>Your Origin software will return the Computer ID to the Script Window. In the event that multiple IDs are reported, the ID marked by an asterisk (*) will be the Computer ID that you are looking for.
</p>
<h3><a name="Host_ID"></a><span class="mw-headline">Host ID</span></h3>
<p>The Host ID is your computer's Ethernet Address as reported by LMTools or Physical Address as reported by Command Prompt.
It is used to generate a license for your Concurrent Network License server or submit a System Transfer request.
</p><p>To find the Host ID for your system, please see the appropriate page for your OS:
