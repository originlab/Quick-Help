<h1 class="firstHeading">3.101 FAQ-631 How to report FWHM for each peak in a single dataset Gaussian fit?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>FWHM-for-multi-peak-curve</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 7/20/2018</p>
<p>To report the full width at half maximum (FWHM) for each peak in a single dataset Gaussian fit, select <b>Analysis: Peaks and Baseline: Peak Analyzer</b> and perform the Gaussian fitting, and you will get FWHM value for each peak from the PeakProperties result sheet.
