<h1 class="firstHeading">3.62 FAQ-298 How do I set the bound for fitting for some functions?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Set-Bound-for-Fitting</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>In the case that a fitting operation fails to converge, consider setting bounds on selected fitting parameters.  Although there is no guarantee of a particular fit operation converging, the suggestions below can be useful for certain cases.
</p><p>Often, once the bounded fit converges, resetting or releasing the bound(s) and fitting again will yield a converged fit as well.
</p><p>The following fitting functions are mostly used in Peak Analyzer. Some of them may also be used in NLFit.

<td>Set a small upper bound for the parameter <code>a</code>, i.e, <code>a&lt;=2</code>, when there is too much oscillation in the fit curve following the first fitting attempt.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>GaussianLorenCross</b>
</td>
<td>Set a bound for <code>s</code>, such as <code>0.25&lt;=s&lt;=0.75</code>.  Reset or release the bound once the fit converges .

</td>
<td>Fitting a negative peak is not recommended for if the <code>x</code> coordinate of the peak center is not positive.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Pulse</b>
</td>
<td>This function is for fitting positive peaks. Note that the amplitude <code>A</code> is set to have a positive bound. For negative peak, the fitting may fail to converge.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ECS</b>
</td>
<td>This function is more suitable for fitting positive peaks. But you can release the bound for the amplitude <code>A</code> for negative peak fitting.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>PearsonVII</b>
</td>
<td>This function is more suitable for fitting positive peaks. But you can release the bound on the amplitude <code>A</code> for negative peak fitting.
</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Weibull3</b>
</td>
<td>To get a suitable convergent fit, you may need to set <code>w2</code> to a suitable value for your data, as <code>w2</code> will affect the shape of the fitted curve. For example, you can fix <code>w2=3.4</code> to get a shape like Gaussian. It is not recommended to free the <code>w2</code>. You can set a suitable bound for <code>w2</code> around 3.4, for an asymmetric peak fitting.
