<h1 class="firstHeading">5.5 FAQ-342 How do I resize dialogs such as multipanel dialogs?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Resize-Dialog</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 7/5/2019</p>
<p>Many dialogs such as the Nonlinear Curve Fitter have multiple panels which can be turned on or off by clicking the double arrow buttons in the dialog. When the dialog is resized, the behavior of what gets resized may be related to what panels are on/off. It is then possible that with a certain configuration, resizing the dialog can result in a particular panel being too small or too large.
</p><p>The easy way to fix this is to try closing all other panels and then resize the remaining panel to set the desired size, and then reopen the other panels.
