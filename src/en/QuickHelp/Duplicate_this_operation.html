<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 4/21/2021</p>
<p>Beginning with Origin 2021b, you can <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Recalculating_Analysis_Results.html#Context_Menu_for_Locked_Operations">click on an operations lock</a> and from the menu, choose <b>Duplicate this Operation</b>. The idea is that an analysis lock is linked to a particular set of outputs (e.g. analysis report sheets, result sheets, graphical output) and if you were to change analysis parameters -- which you can do by clicking on the same lock and choosing <b>Change Parameters</b> -- you would lose your original results.

</p><p>So, to preserve your original output(s), you (1) click on a lock icon and (2) <b>Duplicate this Operation</b>. This adds a duplicate operation to the window, including a duplicate set of outputs. You can now (3) click one of the duplicate locks (either the new one or the original) and choose <b>Change Parameters</b> to modify analysis parameters and (4) generate new output with new parameters. The output associated with the unmodified analysis remains, allowing you to compare the two.
