<p>This is due to the fact that Origin is set to not allow font embedding with exported PDFs in general when it is accessed via Remote Desktop. You can force the font embedding (which may cause the text to be drawn poorly during PDF export) by setting a system variable: @EMRD=0 by typing "@EMRD=0;" in <b>Command Window</b> or <b>Script Window</b> to run. Below is an example where we used <i>Arial Garamond Pro</i> as embedding font, when set @EMRD=0, in the exported PDF file you can see:

<p>If it works for you, you can set it to always be on by going to the <b>Preferences</b> menu and select <b>System Variables</b>. In the dialog, enter EMRD in <b>Variable</b> column and set it to 0 in <b>Value</b> column. It will always be on unless you delete it from the <a class="external text" href="../../UserGuide/UserGuide/Set_System_Variables_Dialog_Box.html"><b>Set System Variables </b>Dialog</a> or set it to 2 in the dialog.
