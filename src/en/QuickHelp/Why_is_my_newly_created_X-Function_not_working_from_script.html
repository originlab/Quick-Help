<h1 class="firstHeading">4.41 FAQ-402 Why is my newly created X-Function not working from script?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>XF-Name-Conflict-with-LT</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>When a command is executed in script, the execution order of priority is <b>LabtTalk</b> command &gt; <b>OGS</b> file &gt; <b>X-Function</b>. So, when you create a new X-Function, and the name may be conflicting with a LabTalk command name or an OGS script file name in the current working directory, which makes the X-Function fail to work from script, please re-name the X-Function and try again.
