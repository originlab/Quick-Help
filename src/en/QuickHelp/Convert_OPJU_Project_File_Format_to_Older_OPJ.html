<h1 class="firstHeading">2.89 FAQ-927 Is there some way to convert the new OPJU file format into the older OPJ format?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Convert-OPJU-Project-File-Format-to-Older-OPJ</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 1/5/2023</p>
<p>Origin 2018 introduced a new Unicode-compliant (UTF-8) project file type -- the <b>OPJU</b> file. These files cannot be opened in earlier versions of Origin (though, it should be noted that Origin 2018 through Origin 2022b retain the ability to save files in the older OPJ format). New features in Origin 2023 and later require the OPJU format and therefore cannot save as OPJ.
</p><p>If you cannot open an <b>OPJU</b> file with your Origin software, do this:
</p>
<ol><li> Download the Origin Viewer by visiting <a class="external text" href="https://www.originlab.com/viewer/dl.aspx" target="_blank">this page</a> on the OriginLab website.</li>
<li> Unzip the contents of the Viewer file download.</li>
<li> Double-click on the EXE to run the Viewer (no installation required), then choose <b>File: Save Project As</b> from the Viewer menu and re-save the project as an <b>OPJ</b> file.</li></ol>
<p><br />
