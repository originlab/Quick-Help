<p>When you have a histogram plot, if you perform a nonlinear curve fit on the data, what you end up fitting is the raw data and not the binned data. 
</p><p>To display a fitted curve on histogram, you can choose one of the following two methods:
</p>
<h4><a name="Method_1:_Perform_distribution_fit_on_raw_data"></a><span class="mw-headline">Method 1: Perform distribution fit on raw data</span></h4>
<ol><li>Activate source worksheet. Select <b>Statistics:Descriptive Statistics: Distribution Fit</b> from menu.</li>
<li>Specify the distribution(s) you want to fit the data on <b>Distributions</b> tab. Make sure <b>Histogram</b> is selected on the <b>Plots</b> tab.</li>
<li>Specify other settings if needed. Click <b>OK</b> to perform distribution fit.</li>
<li>In the result sheet <b>Dist1</b> that generates, you will find the histogram plot with distribution curve overlaid in the Histogram branch.</li></ol>
<h4><a name="Method_2:_Turn_on_distribution_curve_on_histogram"></a><span class="mw-headline">Method 2: Turn on distribution curve on histogram</span></h4>
<ol><li>Double click on the histogram to open the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog. </li>
<li>In the <b>Distribution Curve</b> group of <b>Data</b> tab, select one distribution type from the <b>Type</b> drop-down list.</li>
<li>Click <b>OK</b> button to show the distribution curve overlaying the histogram plot.</li></ol>
<p><br />
If you still want to fit the binned data, you can perform a frequency count on the raw data and then fit the bin counts with <b>Nonlinear Curve Fit</b> tool. But do keep in mind that performing a nonlinear curve fit on a histogram is not appropriate because of the following two concerns:
</p>
<ol><li>The bin counts are non-negative and thus measurement errors are asymmetric. </li>
<li>The bin counts are not independent. </li></ol>
<p>To fit the binned data:
</p>
<ol><li>With the raw data active, select <b>Statistics: Descriptive Statistics: Frequency Counts</b> to perform the frequency count.  A new worksheet will be created from which you can plot the Counts column as a column plot. </li>
<li>With that plot active, you can open the NLFit dialog and fit the data.</li></ol>
<p><i>Alternatively</i>,
</p>
<ol><li>Right-click on your histogram plot and choose <b>Go to Bin Worksheet</b> from the context menu. A new worksheet will be created containing the bin data. Since version 8.5.1 you can also click the <b>Go to Bin Worksheet</b> button on the <b>Data</b> tab of the <b>Plot Details</b> dialog to go to the bin worksheet. </li>
<li>Create your column plot from this bin worksheet. </li>
<li>With that new column plot active, you can fit the data with NLFit dialog.</li></ol>
