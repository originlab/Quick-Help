<h1 class="firstHeading">6.31 FAQ-35 When I try to get a license, I'm asked for an Access Code. What is this and why do I see this?</h1><p class='urlname' style='display: none'>Admin-Code-for-Licensing</p>
<p class='faqID'>Last Update: 2/4/2015</p>
<p>The Access Code is provided on the License Certificate for multi-user packages as well as on the serial number label. A Software Administrator can enter the Access Code and set up the License Access Restrictions. A user also needs to enter the Access Code during licensing process. If you have any questions about the License Access Restrictions, please <a class="external text" href="http://www.originlab.com/www/company/qform.aspx?s=1&amp;sbj=tech@2" target="_blank">contact OriginLab Support</a>.
