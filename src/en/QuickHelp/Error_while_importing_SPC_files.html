<p>If you try to import an SPC file into Origin and get an error similar to:
</p><p><font color="red"><b>Error:</b> File "C:\some\folder\MyFile.spc" cannot be opened!</font>
</p><p>Then most likely the issue is that a certain DLL Origin uses for SPC import was not properly registered during Origin installation or it has become unregistered for an unknown reason.
</p><p>Simply run Origin one time as Administrator by right-clicking on the Origin application icon and choosing <b>Run as Administrator</b> or <b>More&gt;Run as Administrator</b>. (You may have to restart Windows afterwards but probably not.)
</p><p>If that does not fix the issue, it may be the case that your SPC file is not, in fact, a Thermo-Galactic SPC file. Another instrument manufacturer uses .SPC for its file extension even though the files are not actually Thermo-Galactic SPC files. Origin cannot import those files.
